from the farther footpath along which she sailed. And Father Conmee
smiled and saluted.</div><div class="speaker"><span class="speaker">Fr Conmee: </span>How do you do?</div><div class="speaker"><span class="speaker">Fr Conmee: </span>A fine carriage she has. Like Mary, queen of Scots, something.
And to think that she is a pawnbroker! Well, now. Such a ... what
should I say? ... such a queenly mien.</div><div class="narrator"><span class="narrator">N1: </span>Father Conmee walked down Great Charles street and glanced
at the shutup free church on his left.</div><div class="speaker"><span class="speaker">Fr Conmee: </span>The reverend T. R. Greene
B. A. will (D. V.) speak. The incumbent they called him. He feels it
incumbent on him to say a few words. But one should be charitable.
Invincible ignorance. They act according to their lights.</div><div class="narrator"><span class="narrator">N1: </span>Father Conmee turned the corner and walked along the North
Circular road.</div><div class="speaker"><span class="speaker">Fr Conmee: </span>It is a wonder that there is not a tramline in such
an important thoroughfare. Surely, there ought to be.</div><div class="narrator"><span class="narrator">N1: </span>A band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from Richmond street.
All raised untidy caps. Father Conmee greeted them more than once
benignly.</div><div class="speaker"><span class="speaker">Fr Conmee: </span>Christian brother boys.</div><div class="narrator"><span class="narrator">N1: </span>Father Conmee smelled incense on his right hand as he walked.</div><div class="speaker"><span class="speaker">Fr Conmee: </span>Saint Joseph's church, Portland row.
For aged and virtuous females.</div><div class="narrator"><span class="narrator">N1: </span>Father Conmee raised his hat to the Blessed Sacrament.</div><div class="speaker"><span class="speaker">Fr Conmee: </span>Virtuous: but
occasionally they are also badtempered.</div><div class="narrator"><span class="narrator">N1: </span>Near Aldborough house Father Conmee thought of that
spendthrift nobleman.</div><div class="speaker"><span class="speaker">Fr Conmee: </span>And now it is an office or something.</div><div class="narrator"><span class="narrator">N1: </span>Father Conmee began to walk along the North Strand road and
was saluted by Mr William Gallagher who stood in the doorway of
his shop. Father Conmee saluted Mr William Gallagher and perceived
the odours that came from baconflitches and ample cools of butter. He
passed Grogan's the Tobacconist against which newsboards leaned and
told of a dreadful catastrophe in New York.</div><div class="speaker"><span class="speaker">Fr Conmee: </span>In America those things
are continually happening. Unfortunate people to die like that,
unprepared. Still, an act of perfect contrition.</div><div class="narrator"><span class="narrator">N1: </span>Father Conmee went by Daniel Bergin's publichouse against the
window of which two unlabouring men lounged. They saluted him
and were saluted.</div><div class="narrator"><span class="narrator">N1: </span>Father Conmee passed H. J. O'Neill's funeral establishment
where Corny Kelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed
a blade of hay. A constable on his beat saluted Father Conmee and
Father Conmee saluted the constable. In Youkstetter's, the

porkbutcher's, Father Conmee observed pig's puddings, white and black
and red, lie neatly curled in tubes.</div><div class="narrator"><span class="narrator">N1: </span>Moored under the trees of Charleville Mall Father Conmee saw
a turfbarge, a towhorse with pendent head, a bargeman with a hat of
dirty straw seated amidships, smoking and staring at a branch of poplar
above him. It was idyllic. ||</div><div class="narrator"><span class="narrator">N1: </span>And Father Conmee reflected on the
providence of the Creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men
might dig it out and bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in
the houses of poor people. ||</div><div class="narrator"><span class="narrator">N1: </span>On Newcomen bridge the very reverend John Conmee S. J. of
saint Francis Xavier's church, upper Gardiner street, stepped on to an
outward bound tram.</div><div class="narrator"><span class="narrator">N1: </span>Off an inward bound tram stepped the reverend Nicholas Dudley
C. C. of saint Agatha's church, north William street, on to Newcomen
bridge.</div><div class="narrator"><span class="narrator">N1: </span>At Newcomen bridge Father Conmee stepped into an outward
bound tram for he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past Mud
Island.</div><span class="stage">
            [Fr. Conmee sits down]
        </span><div class="narrator"><span class="narrator">N1: </span>Father Conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar, a blue ticket tucked
with care in the eye of one plump kid glove, while four shillings, a
sixpence and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into
his purse. Passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket inspector
usually made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away the ticket.
The solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to Father Conmee
excessive for a journey so short and cheap. Father Conmee liked
cheerful decorum.</div><div class="narrator"><span class="narrator">N1: </span>It was a peaceful day. || The gentleman with his glasses opposite
Father Conmee had finished explaining and looked down.</div><div class="speaker"><span class="speaker">Fr Conmee: </span>His wife</div><div class="narrator"><span class="narrator">N1: </span>Father Conmee supposed. A tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife
of the gentleman with the glasses. She raised her small gloved fist,
yawned ever so gently, tiptapping her small gloved fist on her opening
mouth and smiled tinily, sweetly.</div><div class="narrator"><span class="narrator">N1: </span>Father Conmee perceived her perfume in the car. He perceived
also that the awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the
edge of the seat.</div>
		<hr width="50%">
		<div><div class="narrator"><span class="narrator">N*: </span>Father Conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in
    the mouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head.</div>
		</div>
		<hr width="50%"><div class="narrator"><span class="narrator">N1: </span>At Annesley bridge the tram halted and, when it was about to go,
an old woman rose suddenly from her place to alight. The conductor
pulled the bellstrap to stay the car for her. She passed out with her
basket and a market net: and Father Conmee saw the conductor help

her and net and basket down: and Father Conmee thought that, as she
had nearly passed the end of the penny fare, she was one of those good
souls who had always to be told twice:</div><div class="speaker"><span class="speaker">Fr Conmee: </span>Bless you, my child.</div><div class="narrator"><span class="narrator">N1: </span>That they have been absolved.</div><div class="speaker"><span class="speaker">Fr Conmee: </span>Pray for me.</div><div class="speaker"><span class="speaker">Fr Conmee: </span>But they have so many worries in life, so
many cares, poor creatures.</div><div class="narrator"><span class="narrator">N1: </span>From the hoardings Mr Eugene Stratton grinned with thick
niggerlips at Father Conmee.</div><div class="narrator"><span class="narrator">N1: </span>Father Conmee thought of:</div><div class="speaker"><span class="speaker">Fr Conmee: </span>The souls of black and brown and
yellow men</div><div class="narrator"><span class="narrator">N1: </span>and of his sermon of</div><div class="speaker"><span class="speaker">Fr Conmee: </span>saint Peter Claver S. J. and the
African mission and of the propagation of the faith and of the millions
of black and brown and yellow souls that have not received the baptism
of water when their last hour comes like a thief in the night.</div><div class="narrator"><span class="narrator">N1: </span>That book
by the Belgian jesuit,</div>
		<div class="speaker"><span class="speaker">Fr Conmee: </span><span class="title">Le Nombre des Élus</span></div><div class="narrator"><span class="narrator">N1: </span>Seemed to Father Conmee a reasonable plea.</div><div class="speaker"><span class="speaker">Fr Conmee: </span>Those are millions of human souls created by God
in His Own likeness to whom the faith has not (D.V.) been brought.
But they are God's souls created by God.</div><div class="narrator"><span class="narrator">N1: </span>It seemed to Father
Conmee a pity that they should all be lost, a waste if one might say.</div><div class="narrator"><span class="narrator">N1: </span>At the Howth road stop Father Conmee alighted
<span class="stage">
            [Fr. Conmee stands up]
        </span>,
was saluted by
the conductor and saluted in his turn.</div><div class="narrator"><span class="narrator">N1: </span>The Malahide road was quiet. It pleased Father Conmee, road
and name.</div><div class="speaker"><span class="speaker">Fr Conmee: </span>The joybells were ringing in gay Malahide. Lord Talbot de
Malahide, immediate hereditary lord admiral of Malahide and the seas
adjoining. Then came the call to arms and she was maid, wife and
widow in one day. Those were old worldish days, loyal times in joyous
townlands, old times in the barony.</div><div class="narrator"><span class="narrator">N1: </span>Father Conmee, walking, thought of his little book <span class="title">Old Times in
the Barony</span> and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses
and of Mary Rochfort, daughter of lord Molesworth, first countess of
Belvedere.</div><div class="narrator"><span class="narrator">N1: </span>A listless lady, no more young, walked alone the shore of lough
Ennel, Mary, first countess of Belvedere, listlessly walking in the
evening, not startled when an otter plunged.</div><div class="speaker"><span class="speaker">Fr Conmee: </span>Who could know the
truth? Not the jealous lord Belvedere and not her confessor if she had
not committed adultery fully, <span class="language">eiaculatio seminis inter vas naturale
mulieris</span>, with her husband's brother?
She would half confess if she had
not all sinned as women do. Only God knows and she and he, her
husband's brother.</div><div class="narrator"><span class="narrator">N1: </span>Father Conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence, needed
however for man's race on earth, and of the ways of God which were
not our ways.</div><div class="narrator"><span class="narrator">N1: </span>Don John Conmee walked and moved in times of yore. He was

humane and honoured there. He bore in mind secrets confessed and
he smiled at smiling noble faces in a beeswaxed drawingroom, ceiled
with full fruit clusters. And the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom,
noble to noble, were impalmed by Don John Conmee. ||</div><div class="narrator"><span class="narrator">N1: </span>It was a charming day. ||</div><div class="narrator"><span class="narrator">N1: </span>The lychgate of a field showed Father Conmee breadths of
cabbages, curtseying to him with ample underleaves. The sky showed him
a flock of small white clouds going slowly down the wind.</div><div class="speaker"><span class="speaker">Fr Conmee: </span><span class="language">Moutonner</span>,
the French say. A just and homely word.</div><div class="narrator"><span class="narrator">N1: </span>Father Conmee, reading his office, watched a flock of muttoning
clouds over Rathcoffey. His thinsocked ankles were tickled by the
stubble of Clongowes field. He walked there, reading in the evening,
and heard the cries of the boys' lines at their play, young cries in the
quiet evening. He was their rector: his reign was mild.</div><div class="narrator"><span class="narrator">N1: </span>Father Conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged
breviary out. An ivory bookmark told him the page.</div><div class="speaker"><span class="speaker">Fr Conmee: </span>Nones. I should have read that before lunch. But lady Maxwell
came.</div><div class="narrator"><span class="narrator">N1: </span>Father Conmee read in secret <span class="language">Pater</span> and

drooping eye at a pine coffinlid sentried in a corner. He pulled himself
erect, went to it and, spinning it on its axle, viewed its shape and brass

to the doorway. There he tilted his hatbrim to give shade to his eyes

pawing the pound and half of Mangan's, late Fehrenbach's, porksteaks

was too blooming dull sitting in the parlour with Mrs Stoer and Mrs
Quigley and Mrs MacDowell and the blind down and they all at their
sniffles and sipping sups of the superior tawny sherry uncle Barney
brought from Tunney's. And they eating crumbs of the cottage
fruitcake, jawing the whole blooming time and sighing.</div><div class="narrator"><span class="narrator">N18: </span>After Wicklow lane the window of Madame Doyle, court dress

lamb, will meet sergeantmajor Bennett, the Portobello bruiser, for
a purse of fifty sovereigns.</div><div class="speaker"><span class="speaker">Master Dignam: </span>God, that'd be a good pucking match to see.

telling the men how to get it round the bend. A big coffin it was, and
high and heavylooking. How was that? The last night pa was boosed
he was standing on the landing there bawling out for his boots to go
out to Tunney's for to boose more and he looked butty and short
in his shirt. Never see him again. Death, that is. Pa is dead. My
father is dead. He told me to be a good son to ma. I couldn't hear
the other things he said but I saw his tongue and his teeth trying to
say it better. Poor pa. That was Mr Dignam, my father. I hope he is
in purgatory now because he went to confession to father Conroy on
Saturday night.</div>
