\N2:
Mr Bloom, strolling towards Brunswick street, smiled.

\BloomInt:
My missus has just got an.
Reedy freckled soprano.
Cheeseparing nose.
Nice enough in its way: for a little ballad.
No guts in it.
You and me, don't you know:
in the same boat.
Softsoaping.
Give you the needle that would.
Can't he hear the difference?
Think he's that way inclined a bit.
Against my grain somehow.
Thought that Belfast would fetch him.
I hope that smallpox up there doesn't get worse.
Suppose she wouldn't let herself be vaccinated again.
Your wife and my wife.
\gab{190}

\BloomInt:
Wonder is he pimping after me?

\N2:
Mr Bloom stood at the corner,
his eyes wandering over the multicoloured hoardings.
Cantrell and Cochrane's Ginger Ale (Aromatic).
Clery's Summer Sale.

\BloomInt:
No, he's going on straight.
Hello.
\Title{Leah} tonight.
Mrs Bandmann Palmer.
Like to see her again in that.
\Title{Hamlet} she played last night.
Male impersonator.
Perhaps he was a woman.
Why Ophelia committed suicide.
Poor papa!
How he used to talk of Kate Bateman in that.
Outside the Adelphi in London
waited all the afternoon to get in.
Year before I was born
that was:
sixtyfive.
And Ristori in Vienna.
What is this the right name is?
By Mosenthal it is.
\gab{200}
Rachel, is it?
No.
The scene he was always talking about
where the old blind Abraham recognises the voice
and puts his fingers on his face.

\BloomInt:
Nathan's voice!
His son's voice!
I hear the voice of Nathan who left his father
to die of grief and misery in my arms,
who left the house of his father
and left the God of his father.

\virag:
Every word is so deep, Leopold.

\BloomInt:
Poor papa!
Poor man!
I'm glad I didn't go into the room to look at his face.
That day!
O, dear!
O, dear!
Ffoo!
Well, perhaps it was best for him.

\N2:
Mr Bloom went round the corner
\gab{210}
and passed the drooping nags of the hazard.

\BloomInt:
No use thinking of it any more.
Nosebag time.
Wish I hadn't met that M'Coy fellow.

\N1:
He came nearer and heard a crunching of gilded oats,
the gently champing teeth.
Their full buck eyes regarded him as he went by,
amid the sweet oaten reek of horsepiss.

\BloomInt:
Their Eldorado.
Poor jugginses!
Damn all they know or care about anything
with their long noses stuck in nosebags.
Too full for words.
Still they get their feed all right and their doss.
Gelded too:
a stump of black guttapercha wagging limp between their haunches.
Might be happy all the same that way.
Good poor brutes they look.
Still their neigh can be very irritating.
\gab{220}

\N1:
He drew the letter from his pocket
and folded it into the newspaper he carried.

\BloomInt:
Might just walk into her here.
The lane is safer.

\N1:
He passed the cabman's shelter.

\BloomInt:
Curious the life of drifting cabbies.
All weathers, all places,
time or setdown,
no will of their own.
\italian{Voglio e Non.}
Like to give them an odd cigarette.
Sociable.
Shout a few flying syllables as they pass.

\N1:
He hummed:

\BloomInt:
\begin{verse}
    La ci darem la mano \\
    La la lala la la.
\end{verse}

\N1:
He turned into Cumberland street
and, going on some paces,
halted in the lee of the station wall.

\BloomInt:
No-one.
Meade's timberyard.
\gab{230}
Piled balks.
Ruins and tenements.

\N1:
With careful tread
he passed over a hopscotch court with its forgotten pickeystone.

\BloomInt:
Not a sinner.

\N1:
Near the timberyard a squatted child at marbles,
alone,
shooting the taw with a cunnythumb.
A wise tabby, a blinking sphinx,
watched from her warm sill.

\BloomInt:
Pity to disturb them.
Mohammed cut a piece out of his mantle not to wake her.
Open it.
And once I played marbles when I went to that old dame's school.
She liked mignonette.
Mrs Ellis's.
And Mr?

\N1:
He opened the letter within the newspaper.

\BloomInt:
A flower.
I think it's a.
A yellow flower with flattened petals.
Not annoyed then?
\gab{240}
What does she say?

\martha:
Dear Henry

\martha:
I got your last letter to me and thank you very much for it.
I am sorry you did not like my last letter.
Why did you enclose the stamps?
I am awfully angry with you.
I do wish I could punish you for that.
I called you naughty boy
because I do not like that other world.
Please tell me what is the real meaning of that word?
Are you not happy in your home
you poor little naughty boy?
I do wish I could do something for you.
Please tell me what you think of poor me.
I often think of the beautiful name you have.
Dear Henry,
when will we meet?
I think of you so often
you have no idea.
I have never felt myself so much drawn to a man as you.
\gab{250}
I feel so bad about.
Please write me a long letter and tell me more.
Remember if you do not
I will punish you.
So now you know what I will do to you,
you naughty boy, if you do not wrote.
O how I long to meet you.
Henry dear, do not deny my request before my patience are exhausted.
Then I will tell you all.
Goodbye now, naughty darling,
I have such a bad headache today.
And write \emph{by return} to your longing

\martha:
Martha

\martha:
P.S. Do tell me what kind of perfume does your wife use.
I want to know.

\martha: x x x x

\N1:
He tore the flower gravely from its pinhold |
\gab{260}
smelt its almost no smell
and placed it in his heart pocket.

\BloomInt:
Language of flowers.
They like it
because no-one can hear.
Or a poison bouquet to strike him down.

\N2:
Then walking slowly forward
he read the letter again,
murmuring here and there a word.

\BloomInt:
Angry tulips with you darling manflower |
punish your cactus if you don't |
please poor forgetmenot |
how I long violets to dear roses |
when we |
soon anemone meet |
all naughty nightstalk |
wife |
Martha's perfume.

\N2:
Having read it all
he took it from the newspaper and put it back in his sidepocket.

\N2:
Weak joy opened his lips.

\BloomInt:
Changed since the first letter.
Wonder did she wrote it herself.
Doing the indignant:
a girl of good family like me, respectable character.
\gab{270}
Could meet one Sunday after the rosary.
Thank you: not having any.
Usual love scrimmage.
Then running round corners.
Bad as a row with Molly.
Cigar has a cooling effect.
Narcotic.
Go further next time.
Naughty boy:
punish:
afraid of words, of course.
Brutal, why not?
Try it anyhow.
A bit at a time.

\N2:
Fingering still the letter in his pocket
he drew the pin out of it.

\BloomInt:
Common pin, eh?

\N2:
He threw it on the road.

\BloomInt:
Out of her clothes somewhere:
pinned together.
Queer the number of pins they always have.
No roses without thorns.

\N1:
Flat Dublin voices bawled in his head.

\BloomInt:
Those two sluts that night in the Coombe,
\gab{280}
linked together in the rain.

\sluts:
\begin{verse}
    O, Mary lost the pin of her drawers. \\
    She didn't know what to do \\
    To keep it up \\
    To keep it up.
\end{verse}

\BloomInt:
It?
Them.
Such a bad headache.
Has her roses probably.
Or sitting all day typing.
Eyefocus bad for stomach nerves.
What perfume does your wife use.
Now could you make out a thing like that?

\sluts:
\begin{verse}
    To keep it up.
\end{verse}

\BloomInt:
Martha, Mary.
I saw that picture somewhere I forget now
old master or faked for money.
\gab{290}
He is sitting in their house, talking.
Mysterious.
Also the two sluts in the Coombe would listen.

\sluts:
\begin{verse}
    To keep it up.
\end{verse}

\BloomInt:
Nice kind of evening feeling.
No more wandering about.
Just loll there:
quiet dusk:
let everything rip.
Forget.
Tell about places you have been,
strange customs.
The other one,
jar on her head,
was getting the supper:
fruit, olives,
lovely cool water out of a well,
stonecold like the hole in the wall at Ashtown.
Must carry a paper goblet next time I go to the trottingmatches.
She listens with big dark soft eyes.
Tell her:
more and more:
all.
Then a sigh:
silence.
Long long long rest.

\N1:
Going under the railway arch
he took out the envelope,
\gab{300}
tore it swiftly in shreds
and scattered them towards the road.
The shreds fluttered away,
sank in the dank air:
a white flutter, then all sank.

\BloomInt:
Henry Flower.
You could tear up a cheque for a hundred pounds in the same way.
Simple bit of paper.
Lord Iveagh once cashed a sevenfigure cheque for a million in the bank of Ireland.
Shows you the money to be made out of porter.
Still the other brother
lord Ardilaun
has to change his shirt four times a day,
they say.
Skin breeds lice or vermin.
A million pounds, wait a moment.
Twopence a pint,
fourpence a quart,
eightpence a gallon of porter,
no, one and fourpence a gallon of porter.
One and four into twenty:
fifteen about.
Yes, exactly.
\gab{310}
Fifteen millions of barrels of porter.

\BloomInt:
What am I saying barrels?
Gallons.
About a million barrels all the same.

\N1:
An incoming train clanked heavily above his head, coach after coach.
Barrels bumped in his head:
dull porter slopped and churned inside.
The bungholes sprang open and a huge dull flood leaked out,
flowing together,
winding through mudflats all over the level land,
a lazy pooling swirl of liquor
bearing along wideleaved flowers of its froth.
