\sentence{Women}

\F1:
Yes |
because he [\bloom] never did a~thing like that before |
as ask to get his breakfast in bed with a~couple of eggs

\f1:
since the \Title{City Arms} hotel |
when he used to be pretending to be laid up |
with a~sick voice |
doing his highness |
to make himself interesting for that old faggot Mrs Riordan |
that he thought he had a~great leg of

\f1:
and she never left us a~farthing |
all for masses for herself and her soul |
greatest miser ever was

\f1:
actually afraid to lay out~4d for her methylated spirit |
telling me all her ailments

\f1:
she had too much old chat in her about politics and earthquakes
and the end of the world

\f1:
let us have a~bit of fun first |
God help the world if all the women were her sort |
down on bathingsuits and lownecks
\gab{10}

\f1:
of course nobody wanted her to wear them |
I~suppose she was pious because no man would look at her twice

\f1:
I~hope I'll never be like her |
a~wonder she didn't want us to cover our faces

\f1:
but she was a~welleducated woman certainly |
and her gabby talk about Mr Riordan here and Mr Riordan there |
I~suppose he [\riordan] was glad to get shut of her

\f1:
and her dog smelling my fur
and always edging to get up under my petticoats especially then

\f1:
still I~like that in him [\bloom] |
polite to old women like that |
and waiters and beggars too |
he's not proud out of nothing but not always

\F2:
if ever he got anything really serious the matter with him |
it's much better for them to go into a~hospital where everything is clean |
\gab{20}
but I~suppose I'd have to dring it into him for a~month

\f2:
yes |
and then we'd have a~hospital nurse next thing on the carpet |
have him staying there till they throw him out

\f2:
or a~nun maybe like the smutty photo he has |
she's as much a~nun as I'm not

\f2:
yes |
because they're so weak and puling when they're sick |
they want a~woman to get well

\f2:
if his nose bleeds you'd think it was O~tragic

\f2:
and that dyinglooking one off the south circular |
when he sprained his foot at the choir party at the sugarloaf Mountain |
the day I~wore that dress

\f2:
Miss Stack bringing him flowers |
the worst old ones she could find at the bottom of the basket |
anything at all to get into a~man's bedroom |
with her old maid's voice |
trying to imagine he was dying on account of her

\F4:
to never see thy face again

\f2:
though he looked more like a~man with his beard
\gab{30}
a~bit grown in the bed

\f2:
father was the same

\f2:
besides |
I~hate bandaging and dosing

\f2:
when he [\bloom] cut his toe with the razor paring his corns |
afraid he'd get blood\-poisoning

\f2:
but if it was a~thing I~was sick |
then we'd see what attention |
only of course the woman hides it |
not to give all the trouble they do

\F3:
yes he came somewhere I'm sure by his appetite |
anyway love it's not or he'd be off his feed thinking of her |
so either it was one of those night women |
if it was down there he was really |
and the hotel story |
he made up a~pack of lies to hide it |
planning it

\M1:
Hynes kept me

\m1:
who did~I meet |
ah yes I~met |
do you remember Menton |
and who else |
who |
let me see

\F3:
that big babbyface |
I~saw him [\menton] |
and he not long married |
flirting with a~young girl at Poole's Myriorama |
\gab{40}
and turned my back on him when he slinked out looking quite conscious

\f3:
what harm

\f3:
but he had the impudence to make up to me one time |
well done to him mouth almighty |
and his boiled eyes |
of all the big stupoes I~ever met |
and that's called a~solicitor

\f3:
only for I~hate having a~long wrangle in bed

\f3:
or else if it's not that |
it's some little bitch or other
he [\bloom] got in with somewhere or picked up on the sly |
if they only knew him as well as I~do

\f3:
yes |
because the day before yesterday he was scribbling something |
a~letter |
when I~came into the front room to show him Dignam's death in the paper |
as if something told me |
and he covered it up with the blottingpaper
pretending to be thinking about business

\f3:
so very probably that was it |
to somebody who thinks she has a~softy in him

\f3:
\gab{50}
because all men get a~bit like that at his age |
especially getting on to forty he is now

\f3:
so as to wheedle any money she can out of him

\f3:
no fool like an old fool

\f3:
and then the usual kissing my bottom was to hide it |
not that I~care two straws now who he does it with |
or knew before that way

\F4:
though I'd like to find out |
so long as I~don't have the two of them under my nose all the time |
like that slut that Mary we had in Ontario terrace |
padding out her false bottom to excite him

\f4:
bad enough to get the smell of those painted women off him

\f4:
once or twice I~had a~suspicion by getting him to come near me |
when I~found the long hair on his coat |
without that one |
when I~went into the kitchen |
pretending he was drinking water

\f4:
\gab{60}
1~woman is not enough for them

\f4:
it was all his fault of course |
ruining servants |
then proposing that she could eat at our table on Christmas day |
if you please

\f4:
O~no thank you |
not in my house |
stealing my potatoes and the oysters |
2/6~per doz |
going out to see her aunt if you please |
common robbery so it was

\f4:
but I~was sure he had something on with that one |
it takes me to find out a~thing like that

\f4:
he said

\M1:
you have no proof

\f4:
it was her proof |
O~yes her aunt was very fond of oysters |
but I~told her what I~thought of her suggesting me to go out |
to be alone with her

\f4:
I~wouldn't lower myself to spy on them

\f4:
the garters I~found in her room the Friday she was out |
that was enough for me |
a~little bit too much |
her face swelled up on her with temper |
when I~gave her ~ her week's notice |
\gab{70}
I saw to that

\f4:
better do without them altogether |
do out the rooms myself quicker |
only for the damn cooking and throwing out the dirt

\f4:
I~gave it to him anyhow |
either she or me leaves the house

\f4:
I~couldn't even touch him |
if I~thought he was with a~dirty barefaced liar and sloven like that one |
denying it up to my face |
and singing about the place in the W~C too |
because she knew she was too well off

\f4:
yes |
because he couldn't possibly do without it that long |
so he must do it somewhere

\f4:
and the last time he came on my bottom

\F5:
when was it |
the night Boylan gave my hand a~great squeeze going along by the Tolka |
in my hand there steals another |
I~just pressed the back of his [\boylan] like that with my thumb to squeeze back |
\gab{80}
singing \song{the young May moon she's beaming love}

\f5:
because he [\bloom] has an idea about him [\boylan] and me |
he's [\bloom] not such a~fool |
he said I'm dining out and going to the Gaiety |
though I'm not going to give him the satisfaction in any case

\f5:
God knows he's [\boylan] a~change in a~way |
not to be always and ever wearing the same old hat

\f5:
unless I~paid some nicelooking boy to do it |
since I~can't do it myself

\f5:
a~young boy would like me |
I'd confuse him [\boy] a~little alone with him |
if we were I'd let him see my garters |
the new ones |
and make him turn red

\f5:
looking at him |
seduce him

\f5:
I~know what boys feel with that down on their cheek |
doing that frigging |
drawing out the thing by the hour

\f5:
question and answer

\M2:
[\bloom] would you do this that and the other

\M3:
with the coalman

\f5:
yes

\M1:
with a~bishop

\f5:
yes I~would

\f5:
\gab{90}
because I~told him [\bloom] about some dean or bishop was sitting beside me |
in the jews' temple's gardens when I~was knitting that woollen thing

\f5:
a~stranger to Dublin

\M2:
what place was it

\f5:
and so on about the monuments

\f5:
and he [\bloom] tired me out with statues |
encouraging him |
making him worse than he is

\M3:
who is in your mind

\M1:
now tell me who are you thinking of

\M2:
who is it

\M3:
tell me his name

\M1:
who |
tell me who

\M2:
the german Emperor is it

\f5:
yes

\M2:
imagine I'm him [\emperor] |
think of him |
can you feel him

\f5:
trying to make a~whore of me |
what he [\bloom] never will

\F1:
he ought to give it up now at this age of his life |
simply ruination for any woman and no satisfaction in it |
pretending to like it till he comes |
and then finish it off myself anyway |
and it makes your lips pale

\f1:
anyhow it's done now once and for all |
\gab{100}
with all the talk of the world about it people make

\f1:
it's only the first time |
after that it's just the ordinary |
do it and think no more about it

\F2:
why can't you kiss a~man without going and marrying him first |
you sometimes love to wildly |
when you feel that way so nice all over you |
you can't help yourself

\f2:
I~wish some man or other would take me sometime |
when he's [\bloom] there |
and [\other] kiss me in his arms |
there's nothing like a~kiss long and hot down to your soul |
almost paralyses you then

\f2:
I~hate that confession |
when I~used to go to Father Corrigan

\f2:
he touched me father |
and what harm if he did

\M3:
[\corrigan] where

\f2:
and I~said |
on the canal bank |
like a~fool

\M3:
but whereabouts on your person my child

\f2:
on the leg behind

\M3:
high up was it

\f2:
yes rather high up

\M3:
was it where you sit down

\f2:
yes
\gab{110}

\f2:
O~Lord couldn't he [\corrigan] say bottom right out and have done with it |
what has that got to do with it

\M3:
and did you

\f2:
whatever way he put it I~forget

\f2:
no father

\f2:
and I~always think of the real father

\f2:
what did he [\corrigan] want to know for |
when I~already confessed it to God

\f2:
he had a~nice fat hand |
the palm moist always |
I~wouldn't mind feeling it

\f2:
neither would he |
I'd say by the bullneck in his horsecollar

\f2:
I~wonder did he know me in the box |
I~could see his face |
he couldn't see mine of course |
he'd never turn or let on

\f2:
still his eyes were red when his father died

\f2:
they're lost for a~woman of course |
must be terrible when a~man cries |
let alone them

\f2:
I'd like to be embraced by one in his vestments |
and the smell of incense off him like the pope |
\gab{120}
besides |
there's no danger with a~priest if you're married |
he's too careful about himself |
then give something to His Holiness the pope for a~penance

\F3:
I~wonder was he [\boylan] satisfied with me |
one thing I~didn't like |
his slapping me behind going away so familiarly in the hall |
though I~laughed |
I'm not a~horse or an ass am~I |
I~suppose he was thinking of his father's

\f3:
I~wonder is he awake thinking of me or dreaming |
am~I in it

\f3:
who gave him [\bloom] that flower he said he bought |
he smelt of some kind of drink |
not whisky or stout or perhaps the sweety kind of paste they stick their bills up with |
some liqueur

\f3:
I'd like to sip those richlooking green and yellow expensive drinks |
those stagedoor johnnies drink with the opera hats |
I~tasted once with my finger dipped |
out of that American that had the squirrel |
\gab{130}
talking stamps with father

\f3:
he [\boylan] had all he could do
to keep himself from falling asleep after the last time |
after we took the port and potted meat |
it had a~fine salty taste

\f3:
yes because I~felt lovely and tired myself |
and fell asleep as sound as a~top the moment I~popped straight into bed |
till that thunder woke me up |
God be merciful to us |
I~thought the heavens were coming down about us to punish us |
when I~blessed myself and said a~Hail Mary

\F4:
like those awful thunderbolts in Gibraltar |
as if the world was coming to an end

\f4:
and then they come and tell you there's no God |
what could you do if it was |
running and rushing about |
nothing |
only make an act of contrition

\f4:
the candle I~lit that evening in Whitefriars street chapel for the month of May
\gab{140}

\f4:
see |
it brought its luck

\f4:
though he'd [\bloom] scoff if he heard because he never goes to church mass or meeting |
he says

\M1:
your soul |
you have no soul inside |
only grey matter

\f4:
because he doesn't know what it is to have one

\F5:
yes when I~lit the lamp

\f5:
because he [\boylan] must have come 3~or~4 times
with that tremendous big red brute of a~thing he has |
I~thought the vein or whatever the dickens they call it was going to burst |
though his nose is not so big

\f5:
after I~took off all my things |
with the blinds down |
after my hours dressing and perfuming and combing

\f5:
it like iron or some kind of a~thick crowbar |
standing all the time |
he must have eaten oysters I~think |
a~few dozen

\f5:
he was in great singing voice

\f5:
no I~never in all my life felt anyone had one the size of that to make you feel full up |
\gab{150}
he must have eaten a~whole sheep after

\f5:
what's the idea making us like that with a~big hole in the middle of us |
or like a~Stallion driving it up into you |
because that's all they want out of you

\f5:
with that determined vicious look in his eye |
I~had to halfshut my eyes |
still he hasn't such a~tremendous amount of spunk in him |
when I~made him pull out and do it on me |
considering how big it is

\f5:
so much the better |
in case any of it wasn't washed out properly

\f5:
the last time I~let him finish it in me

\F1:
nice invention they made for women |
for him to get all the pleasure

\f1:
but if someone gave them a~touch of it themselves

\f1:
they'd know what I~went through with Milly |
nobody would believe |
cutting her teeth too

\f1:
and Mina Purefoy's husband

\f1:
give us a~swing out of your whiskers

\f1:
\gab{160}
filling her up with a~child or twins once a~year as regular as the clock |
always with a~smell of children off her

\f1:
the one they called budgers or something like a~nigger |
with a~shock of hair on it |
Jesusjack the child is a~black

\f1:
the last time I~was there a~squad of them falling over one another and bawling |
you couldn't hear your ears |
supposed to be healthy

\f1:
not satisfied till they have us swollen out like elephants or I~don't know what

\F2:
supposing I~risked having another |
not off him [\boylan] |
though still if he was married |
I'm sure he'd have a~fine strong child |
but I~don't know

\f2:
Poldy [\bloom] has more spunk in him

\f2:
yes that'd be awfully jolly

\f2:
I~suppose it was meeting Josie Powell [\josie] and the funeral
and thinking about me and Boylan set him [\bloom] off

\f2:
\gab{170}
well he can think what he likes now |
if that'll do him any good

\f2:
I~know they [\bloom\ + \josie] were spooning a~bit when I~came on the scene |
he was dancing and sitting out with her the night of Georgina Simpson's housewarming |
and then he wanted to ram it down my neck |
it was on account of not liking to see her a~wallflower |
that was why we had the standup row over politics

\f2:
he began it not me |
when he said about Our Lord being a~carpenter

\f2:
at last he made me cry |
of course a~woman is so sensitive about everything |
I~was fuming with myself after for giving in |
only for I~knew he was gone on me

\f2:
and the first socialist he [\bloom] said He [\ourlord] was |
he [\bloom] annoyed me so much |
I~couldn't put him into a~temper

\f2:
still he knows a~lot of mixedup things |
especially about the body and the inside
\gab{180}

\f2:
I~often wanted to study up that myself what we have inside us |
in that family physician |
I~could always hear his voice talking when the room was crowded and watch him

\f2:
after that I~pretended I~had a~coolness on with her over him |
because he used to be a~bit on the jealous side whenever he asked who are you going to |
and I~said over to Floey

\f2:
and he made me the present of Byron's poems and the three pairs of gloves |
so that finished that

\f2:
I~could quite easily get him to make it up any time |
I~know how I'd

\f2:
even supposing he got in with her [\josie] again |
and was going out to see her somewhere |
I'd know if he refused to eat the onions

\f2:
I~know plenty of ways |
ask him to tuck down the collar of my blouse |
or touch him with my veil and gloves on going out |
\gab{190}
1~kiss then would send them all spinning |
however alright |
we'll see

\f2:
then let him go to her |
she of course would only be too delighted to pretend she's mad in love with him

\f2:
that I~wouldn't so much mind |
I'd just go to her and ask her |
do you love him and look her square in the eyes |
she couldn't fool me

\f2:
but he might imagine he was |
and make a~declaration to her with his plabbery kind of a~manner |
like he did to me

\f2:
though I~had the devil's own job to get it out of him

\f2:
though I~liked him for that |
it showed he could hold in and wasn't to be got for the asking

\f2:
he was on the pop of asking me too |
the night in the kitchen I~was rolling the potato cake

\M2:
there's something I~want to say to you

\f2:
only for I~put him off |
letting on I~was in a~temper |
\gab{200}
with my hands and arms full of pasty flour |
in any case I~let out too much the night before talking of dreams |
so I~didn't want to let him know more than was good for him

\f2:
she used to be always embracing me |
Josie [\josie] |
whenever he was there |
meaning him of course |
glauming me over

\F3:
and when I~said I~washed up and down as far as possible |
asking me

\M2:
did you wash \emph{``possible''}

\f3:
the women are always egging on to that |
putting it on thick when he's there |
they know by his sly eye blinking a~bit |
putting on the indifferent when they come out with something |
the kind he is what spoils him

\f3:
I~don't wonder in the least |
because he was very handsome at that time |
trying to look like Lord Byron

\f3:
I~said I~liked |
though he was too beautiful for a~man |
\gab{210}
and he was a~little |
before we got engaged

\f3:
afterwards though she [\josie] didn't like it so much |
the day I~was in fits of laughing with the giggles

\f3:
I~couldn't stop about all my hairpins falling out one after another
with the mass of hair I~had

\f3:
you're always in great humour she said |
yes because it grigged her because she knew what it meant |
because I~used to tell her a~good bit of what went on between us

\f3:
not all |
but just enough to make her mouth water but that wasn't my fault

\f3:
she didn't darken the door much after we were married |
I~wonder what she's got like now after living with that dotty husband of hers |
she had her face beginning to look drawn and run down the last time I~saw her |
she must have been just after a~row with him [\breen] |
\gab{220}
because I~saw on the moment |
she was edging to draw down a~conversation about husbands |
and talk about him |
to run him down

\f3:
what was it she told me

\f3:
O~yes |
that sometimes he used to go to bed with his muddy boots on |
when the maggot takes him

\f3:
just imagine having to get into bed with a~thing like that |
that might murder you any moment |
what a~man

\f3:
well it's not the one way everyone goes mad |
Poldy [\bloom] anyhow whatever he does
always wipes his feet on the mat when he comes in |
wet or shine |
and always blacks his own boots too |
and he always takes off his hat when he comes up in the street like then

\f3:
and now he's [\breen] going about in his slippers
to look for 10000~pounds for a~postcard |
U~p |
up

\f3:
O~sweetheart May |
wouldn't a~thing like that simply bore you stiff to extinction

\f3:
\gab{230}
actually too stupid even to take his boots off |
now what could you make of a~man like that

\f3:
I'd rather die 20~times over than marry another of their sex

\F4:
of course he'd [\bloom] never find another woman like me to put up with him |
the way I~do

\M3:
know me |
come sleep with me

\f4:
yes and he knows that too |
at the bottom of his heart

\F5:
take that Mrs Maybrick that poisoned her husband |
for what I~wonder |
in love with some other man

\f5:
yes it was

\f5:
found out on her |
wasn't she the downright villain to go and do a~thing like that

\f5:
of course some men can be dreadfully aggravating |
drive you mad |
and always the worst word in the world

\f5:
what do they ask us to marry them for |
if we're so bad as all that comes to

\f5:
yes |
because they can't get on without us

\f5:
\gab{240}
white Arsenic she put in his [\maybrick] tea |
off flypaper wasn't it

\f5:
I~wonder why they call it that |
if I~asked him [\bloom] he'd say it's from the Greek |
leave us as wise as we were before

\f5:
she must have been madly in love with the other fellow |
to run the chance of being hanged |
O~she didn't care |
if that was her nature |
what could she do

\f5:
besides |
they're not brutes enough to go and hang a~woman |
surely are they

\sentence{Men}

\F1:
they're all so different

\f1:
Boylan talking about the shape of my foot |
he [\boylan] noticed at once even before he was introduced |
when I~was in the D~B~C [\dbc] with Poldy |
laughing and trying to listen |
I~was waggling my foot |
we both ordered 2~teas and plain bread and butter

\f1:
I~saw him [\boylan] looking with his two old maids of sisters |
\gab{250}
when I~stood up and asked the girl where it was

\f1:
what do I~care |
with it dropping out of me

\f1:
and that black closed breeches he [\bloom] made me buy |
takes you half an hour to let them down

\f1:
wetting all myself

\f1:
always with some brandnew fad every other week

\f1:
such a~long one I~did

\f1:
I~forgot my suede gloves on the seat behind that I~never got |
after some robber of a~woman

\f1:
and he [\bloom] wanted me to put it in the \Title{Irish Times} |
lost in the ladies' lavatory D~B~C [\dbc] Dame street |
finder return to Mrs Marion Bloom

\f1:
and I~saw his [\boylan] eyes on my feet |
going out through the turning door |
he was looking when I~looked back |
and I~went there for tea 2~days after in the hope |
but he wasn't

\f1:
now how did that excite him |
because I~was crossing them when we were in the other room first

\f1:
\gab{260}
he meant the shoes that are too tight to walk in

\F2:
my hand is nice like that |
if I~only had a~ring with the stone for my month |
a~nice aquamarine |
I'll stick him for one and a~gold bracelet

\f2:
I~don't like my foot so much

\f2:
still I~made him [\bloom] spend once with my foot
the night after Goodwin's botchup of a~concert |
so cold and windy

\f2:
it was well we had that rum in the house to mull and the fire wasn't black out

\f2:
when he asked to take off my stockings |
lying on the hearthrug in Lombard street west |
and another time it was my muddy boots

\F3:
he'd like me to walk in all the horses' dung I~could find |
but of course he's not natural like the rest of the world

\f3:
that~I |
what did he say

\M1:
You could give 9~points in~10 to Katty Lanner and beat her

\f3:
what does that mean I~asked him |
\gab{270}
I~forget what he said

\f3:
because the stoppress edition just passed |
and the man with the curly hair in the Lucan dairy that's so polite |
I~think I~saw his [\lucan] face before somewhere |
I~noticed him when I~was tasting the butter

\f3:
so I~took my time

\f3:
Bartell d'Arcy too that he [\bloom] used to make fun of |
when he [\dArcy] commenced kissing me on the choir stairs

\f3:
after I~sang Gounod's \latin{Ave Maria} |
what are we waiting for |
O~my heart |
kiss me |
straight on the brow and part |
which is my brown part

\f3:
he [\dArcy] was pretty hot for all his tinny voice too |
my low notes he was always raving about |
if you can believe him |
I~liked the way he used his mouth singing

\f3:
then he said wasn't it terrible to do that there in a~place like that |
I~don't see anything so terrible about it

\f3:
I'll tell him [\bloom] about that some day not now and surprise him |
\gab{280}
ay and I'll take him there and show him the very place too we did it |
so now there you are |
like it or lump it

\F4:
he thinks nothing can happen without him knowing

\f4:
he hadn't an idea about my mother till we were engaged |
otherwise he'd never have got me so cheap as he did

\f4:
he was 10~times worse himself anyhow |
begging me to give him a~tiny bit cut off my drawers |
that was the evening coming along Kenilworth square |
he kissed me in the eye of my glove and I~had to take it off

\f4:
asking me questions

\M3:
is it permitted to enquire the shape of your bedroom

\f4:
so I~let him keep it as if I~forgot it to think of me |
when I~saw him slip it into his pocket

\F5:
of course he's mad on the subject of drawers |
that's plain to be seen |
always skeezing at those brazenfaced things on the bicycles |
\gab{290}
with their skirts blowing up to their navels |
even when Milly and~I were out with him at the open air fete |
that one in the cream muslin standing right against the sun |
so he could see every atom she had on

\f5:
when he saw me from behind following in the rain |
I~saw him before he saw me however |
standing at the corner of the Harold's Cross Road with a~new raincoat on |
him with the muffler in the Zingari colours to show off his complexion |
and the brown hat |
looking slyboots as usual |
what was he doing there where he'd no business

\f5:
they can go and get whatever they like |
from anything at all with a~skirt on it and we're not to ask any questions |
but they want to know

\M2:
where were you |
where are you going

\F1:
I~could feel him coming along
\gab{300}
skulking after me |
his eyes on my neck |
he had been keeping away from the house |
he felt it was getting too warm for him |
so I~halfturned and stopped |
then he pestered me to say yes |
till I~took off my glove slowly watching him

\f1:
he said my openwork sleeves were too cold for the rain |
anything for an excuse to put his hand anear me drawers

\f1:
drawers the whole blessed time

\f1:
till I~promised to give him the pair off my doll
to carry about in his waistcoat pocket |
\latin{O~Maria Santisima} he did look a~big fool dreeping in the rain

\F2:
splendid set of teeth he had |
made me hungry to look at them

\f2:
and beseeched of me to lift the orange petticoat I~had~on with the sunray pleats |
that there was nobody |
he said he'd kneel down in the wet if I~didn't |
so persevering he would too |
\gab{310}
and ruin his new raincoat

\f2:
you never know what freak they'd take alone with you |
they're so savage for it

\f2:
if anyone was passing |
so I~lifted them a~bit and touched his trousers outside |
the way I~used to Gardner after with my ring hand |
to keep him [\bloom] from doing worse where it was too public

\f2:
I~was dying to find out was he circumcised

\f2:
he was shaking like a~jelly all over |
they want to do everything too quick |
take all the pleasure out of it

\f2:
and father waiting all the time for his [\father] dinner

\f2:
he [\bloom] told me to say I~left my purse in the butcher's
and had to go back for it

\f2:
what a~Deceiver

\F3:
then he wrote me that letter with all those words in it |
how could he have the face to any woman after his company |
manners making it so awkward

\f3:
after when we met
\gab{320}
asking me

\M1:
have~I offended you

\f3:
with my eyelids down |
of course he saw I~wasn't |
he had a~few brains

\f3:
not like that other fool Henny Doyle |
he [\henny] was always breaking or tearing something in the charades |
I~hate an unlucky man

\m1:
do you know what it means

\f3:
of course I~had to say no for form sake |
don't understand you [\bloom] I~said

\m1:
isn't it natural

\f3:
so it is of course

\f3:
it used to be written up with a~picture of a~woman's |
on that wall in Gibraltar |
with that word I~couldn't find anywhere |
only for children seeing it too young

\f3:
then writing every morning a~letter |
sometimes twice a~day

\f3:
I~liked the way he made love then |
he knew the way to take a~woman

\f3:
when he sent me the 8~big poppies |
because mine was the~8th

\f3:
then I~wrote the night he kissed my heart at Dolphin's barn |
\gab{330}
I~couldn't describe it |
simply |
it makes you feel like nothing on earth

\f3:
but he never knew how to embrace well like Gardner

\F4:
I~hope he'll [\boylan] come on Monday as he said |
at the same time |
four

\f4:
I~hate people who come at all hours |
answer the door |
you think it's the vegetables |
then it's somebody and you all undressed |
or the door of the filthy sloppy kitchen blows open

\f4:
the day old frostyface Goodwin called about the concert in Lombard street |
and I~just after dinner |
all flushed and tossed with boiling old stew

\f4:
don't look at me professor I~had to say |
I'm a~fright

\f4:
yes but he [\goodwin] was a~real old gent in his way |
it was impossible to be more respectful

\f4:
nobody to say you're out |
you have to peep out through the blind

\F5:
like the messengerboy today |
\gab{340}
I~thought it was a~putoff first |
him [\boylan] sending the port and the peaches first |
and I~was just beginning to yawn with nerves |
thinking he was trying to make a~fool of me |
when I~knew his tattarrattat at the door |
he must have been a~bit late

\f5:
because it was 1/4~after~3 when I~saw the 2~Dedalus girls coming from school

\f5:
I~never know the time |
even that watch he [\bloom] gave me never seems to go properly |
I'd want to get it looked after

\f5:
when I~threw the penny to that lame sailor |
\song{for England home and beauty} |
when I~was whistling \song{there is a~charming girl I~love} |
and I~hadn't even put on my clean shift |
or powdered myself or a~thing

\f5:
then this day week we're [\molly\ + \boylan] to go to Belfast

\f5:
just as well he [\bloom] has to go to Ennis |
his father's anniversary the~27th |
\gab{350}
it wouldn't be pleasant if he did

\f5:
suppose our rooms at the hotel were beside each other |
and any fooling went on in the new bed |
I~couldn't tell him [\bloom] to stop and not bother me |
with him [\boylan] in the next room

\f5:
or perhaps some protestant clergyman with a~cough |
knocking on the wall

\f5:
then he'd [\boylan] never believe the next day we didn't do something |
it's all very well a~husband but you can't fool a~lover |
after me telling him we never did anything |
of course he didn't believe me

\F1:
no it's better he's [\bloom] going where he is |
besides |
something always happens with him |
the time going to the Mallow concert at Maryborough |
ordering boiling soup for the two of us |
then the bell rang out |
he walks down the platform with the soup splashing about |
taking spoonfuls of it |
\gab{360}
hadn't he the nerve |
and the waiter after him |
making a~holy show of us |
screeching and confusion |
for the engine to start |
but he wouldn't pay till he finished it |
the two gentlemen in the 3rd~class carriage said he was quite right |
so he was too

\f1:
he's so pigheaded sometimes when he gets a~thing into his head

\f1:
a~good job he was able to open the carriage door with his knife |
or they'd have taken us on to Cork |
I~suppose that was done out of revenge on him

\F2:
O~I~love jaunting in a~train or a~car with lovely soft cushions

\f2:
I~wonder will he [\boylan] take a~1st~class for me |
he might want to do it in the train |
by tipping the guard well

\f2:
O~I~suppose there'll be the usual idiots of men gaping at us with their eyes |
as stupid as ever they can possibly be

\f2:
that was an exceptional man
\gab{370}
that common workman that left us alone in the carriage that day going to Howth |
I'd like to find out something about him [\workman]

\f2:
1~or~2 tunnels perhaps |
then you have to look out of the window

\f2:
all the nicer then coming back |
suppose I~never came back |
what would they say |
eloped with him [\boylan] that gets you on on the stage

\F3:
the last concert I~sang at |
where |
it's over a~year ago |
when was it |
St~Teresa's hall Clarendon~St

\f3:
little chits of missies they have now singing |
Kathleen Kearney and her like

\f3:
on account of father being in the army |
and my singing the absentminded beggar |
and wearing a~brooch for Lord Roberts |
when I~had the map of it all

\f3:
and Poldy not Irish enough |
was it him [\bloom] managed it this time |
I~wouldn't put it past him |
like he got me on to sing in the \latin{Stabat Mater} |
\gab{380}
by going around saying he was putting \song{Lead Kindly Light} to music |
I~put him up to that till the jesuits found out he was a~freemason

\f3:
thumping the piano |
\song{lead Thou me on} |
copied from some old opera

\F4:
yes and he was going about with some of them Sinner Fein lately
or whatever they call themselves |
talking his usual trash and nonsense

\f4:
he says that little man he showed me without the neck |
is very intelligent |
the coming man |
Griffiths is he |
well he [\griffith] doesn't look it |
that's all I~can say |
still it must have been him |
he knew there was a~boycott

\F5:
I~hate the mention of their politics after the war |
that Pretoria and Lady\-smith and Bloem\-fontein |
where Gardner lieutenant Stanley~G |
8th~Battalion 2nd~East Lanc\-a\-shire Regiment |
of enteric fever |
he [\gardner] was a~lovely fellow in khaki and just the right height over me |
\gab{390}
I'm sure he was brave too

\f5:
he said I~was lovely |
the evening we kissed goodbye at the canal lock

\M1:
my Irish beauty

\f5:
he was pale with excitement about going away |
or we'd be seen from the road |
he couldn't stand properly |
and I~so hot as I~never felt

\f5:
they could have made their peace in the beginning |
or old oom Paul and the rest of the other old Krugers |
go and fight it out between them |
instead of dragging on for years |
killing any finelooking men there were with their fever

\f5:
if he was even decently shot |
it wouldn't have been so bad

\F1:
I~love to see a~regiment pass in review |
the first time I~saw the Spanish cavalry at La Roque |
it was lovely after looking across the bay from Algeciras |
all the lights of the rock like fireflies |
or those sham battles on the 15~acres |
\gab{400}
the Black Watch with their kilts |
in time at the march past the 10th~hussars |
the prince of Wales' own |
or the lancers |
O~the lancers they're grand |
or the Dublins that won Tugela

\F2:
his [\boylan] father made his money over selling the horses for the cavalry |
well he could buy me a~nice present up in Belfast after what I~gave him

\f2:
they've lovely linen up there or one of those nice kimono things |
I~must buy a~mothball like I~had before |
to keep in the drawer with them

\f2:
it would be exciting going round with him shopping |
buying those things in a~new city

\f2:
better leave this ring behind |
want to keep turning and turning to get it over the knuckle there

\f2:
or they might bell it round the town in their papers |
or tell the police on me |
but they'd think we're married

\f2:
\gab{410}
O~let them all go and smother themselves for the fat lot I~care

\f2:
he has plenty of money and he's not a~marrying man |
so somebody better get it out of him

\f2:
if I~could find out whether he likes me

\F3:
I~looked a~bit washy of course when I~looked close in the handglass powdering |
a~mirror never gives you the expression

\f3:
besides |
scrooching down on me like that all the time with his big hipbones |
he's heavy too with his hairy chest for this heat

\f3:
always having to lie down for them |
better for him put it into me from behind |
the way Mrs Mastiansky told me her husband made her |
like the dogs do it |
and stick out her tongue as far as ever she could |
and he [\mastiansky] so quiet and mild with his tingating cither

\f3:
can you ever be up to men the way it takes them

\F4:
\gab{420}
lovely stuff in that blue suit he [\boylan] had on |
and stylish tie and socks with the skyblue silk things on them |
he's certainly well off |
I~know by the cut his clothes have and his heavy watch

\f4:
but he was like a~perfect devil for a~few minutes after he came back with the stoppress |
tearing up the tickets and swearing blazes because he lost |
20~quid he said he lost over that outsider that won |
and half he put on for me on account of Lenehan's tip |
cursing him to the lowest pits

\f4:
that sponger [\lenehan] |
he was making free with me after the Glencree dinner |
coming back that long joult over the featherbed mountain

\f4:
after the lord Mayor looking at me with his dirty eyes |
Val Dillon that big heathen |
I~first noticed him [\valdillon] at dessert
when I~was cracking the nuts with my teeth

\f4:
\gab{430}
I~wished I~could have picked every morsel of that chicken out of my fingers |
it was so tasty and browned and as tender as anything |
only for I~didn't want to eat everything on my plate |
those forks and fishslicers were hallmarked silver too |
I~wish I~had some |
I~could easily have slipped a~couple into my muff when I~was playing with them

\F5:
then always hanging out of them for money in a~restaurant |
for the bit you put down your throat |
we have to be thankful for our mangy cup of tea itself |
as a~great compliment to be noticed the way the world is divided

\f5:
in any case if it's going to go on |
I~want at least two other good chemises for one thing and

\f5:
but I~don't know what kind of drawers he [\boylan] likes |
none at all I~think |
didn't he say

\f5:
yes |
and half the girls in Gibraltar never wore them either |
\gab{440}
naked as God made them |
that Andalusian singing her Manola |
she didn't make much secret of what she hadn't

\f5:
yes |
and the second pair of silkette stockings is laddered after one day's wear

\f5:
I~could have brought them back to Lewers' this morning and kicked up a~row
and made \emph{that one} change them |
only not to upset myself and run the risk of walking into him [\boylan]
and ruining the whole thing

\f5:
and one of those kidfitting corsets I'd want |
advertised cheap in the Gentlewoman with elastic gores on the hips

\f5:
he [\bloom] saved the one I~have but that's no good

\f5:
what did they say |
they give a~delightful figure line |
11/6 |
obviating that unsightly broad appearance across the lower back to reduce flesh

\F1:
my belly is a~bit too big |
\gab{450}
I'll have to knock off the stout at dinner |
or am~I getting too fond of it

\f1:
the last they sent from O'Rourke's was as flat as a~pancake |
he [\orourke] makes his money |
easy Larry they call him |
the old mangy parcel he sent at Xmas |
a~cottage cake and a~bottle of hogwash he tried to palm off as claret
that he couldn't get anyone to drink |
God spare his spit for fear he'd die of the drouth

\f1:
or I~must do a~few breathing exercises

\f1:
I~wonder is that antifat any good

\f1:
might overdo it

\F2:
the thin ones are not so much the fashion now

\f2:
garters |
that much I~have |
the violet pair I~wore today |
that's all he [\bloom] bought me out of the cheque he got on the first

\f2:
O |
no there was the face lotion I~finished the last of yesterday |
that made my skin like new |
I~told him over and over again |
\gab{460}
get that made up in the same place and don't forget it |
God only knows whether he did after all |
I~said to him I'll know by the bottle

\f2:
anyway if not I~suppose I'll only have to wash in my piss |
like beeftea or chickensoup with some of that opoponax and violet |
I~thought it was beginning to look coarse or old a~bit

\f2:
the skin underneath is much finer where it peeled off there on my finger after the burn |
it's a~pity it isn't all like that

\f2:
and the four paltry handkerchiefs |
about~6/- in all |
sure you can't get on in this world without style

\f2:
all going in food and rent |
when I~get it I'll lash it around I~tell you in fine style

\f2:
I~always want to throw a~handful of tea into the pot

\F3:
measuring and mincing if I~buy a~pair of old brogues itself |
do you like those new shoes
\gab{470}

\M1:
yes |
how much were they

\f3:
I've no clothes at all |
the brown costume |
and the skirt and jacket |
and the one at the cleaners |
3

\f3:
what's that for any woman cutting up this old hat and patching up the other |
the men won't look at you and women try to walk on you because they know you've no man |
then with all the things getting dearer every day

\F4:
for the 4~years' more I~have of life up to~35 |
no I'm |
what am~I at all |
I'll be~33 in September |
will~I |
what

\f4:
O~well |
look at that Mrs~Galbraith |
she's much older than me |
I~saw her when I~was out last week |
her beauty's on the wane |
she was a~lovely woman |
magnificent head of hair on her down to her waist |
tossing it back like that |
like Kitty O'Shea in Grantham street |
1st thing I~did every morning to look across |
see her combing it as if she loved it and was full of it |
\gab{480}
pity I~only got to know her the day before we left

\f4:
and that Mrs~Langtry the jersey lily |
the prince of Wales was in love with |
I~suppose he's [\wales] like the first man going the roads |
only for the name of a~king

\f4:
they're all made the one way |
only a~black man's I'd like to try

\f4:
a~beauty up to |
what was she |
45 |
there was some funny story about the jealous old husband |
what was it at all |
and an oyster knife |
he [\mrlangtry] went |
no |
he made her wear a~kind of a~tin thing round her |
and the prince of Wales |
yes |
he [\wales] had the oyster knife |
can't be true |
a~thing like that

\F5:
like some of those books he [\bloom] brings me |
the works of Master Francois Somebody |
supposed to be a~priest |
about a~child born out of her ear because her bumgut fell out |
\gab{490}
a~nice word for any priest to write |
and her a---e [\arse] |
as if any fool wouldn't know what that meant

\f5:
I~hate that pretending of all things |
with that old blackguard's face on him |
anybody can see it's not true

\f5:
and that Ruby and Fair Tyrants |
he [\bloom] brought me that twice |
I~remember when I~came to page~50 |
the part about where she hangs him up out of a~hook with a~cord |
flagellate

\f5:
sure there's nothing for a~woman in that |
all invention made up |
about he drinking the champagne out of her slipper after the ball was over

\f5:
like the infant Jesus in the crib at Inchicore in the Blessed Virgin's arms |
sure no woman could have a~child that big taken out of her |
and I~thought first it came out of her side |
because how could she go to the chamber when she wanted~to

\f5:
and she [\mrslangtry] a~rich lady |
of course she felt honoured |
\gab{500}
His Royal Highness |
he [\wales] was in Gibraltar the year I~was born |
I~bet he found lilies there too where he planted the tree |
he planted more than that in his time |
he might have planted me too if he'd come a~bit sooner |
then I~wouldn't be here as I~am

\F1:
he [\bloom] ought to chuck that Freeman with the paltry few shillings he knocks out of it |
and go into an office or something where he'd get regular pay |
or a~bank where they could put him up on a~throne to count the money all the day |
of course he prefers plottering about the house so you can't stir with him |
any side |
what's your programme today

\f1:
I~wish he'd even smoke a~pipe like father to get the smell of a~man |
or pretending to be mooching about for advertisements

\f1:
when he could have been in Mr Cuffe's still

\f1:
\gab{510}
only for what he [\bloom] did then |
sending me to try and patch it up |
I~could have got him promoted there to be the manager

\f1:
he [\cuffe] gave me a~great mirada once or twice |
first he was as stiff as the mischief

\M2:
really and truly Mrs Bloom

\f1:
only I~felt rotten simply with the old rubbishy dress |
that I~lost the leads out of the tails with no cut in it |
but they're coming into fashion again |
I~bought it simply to please him [\bloom]

\f1:
I~knew it was no good by the finish

\f1:
pity I~changed my mind of going to Todd and Burn's as I~said and not Lee's |
it was just like the shop itself |
rummage sale |
a~lot of trash |
I~hate those rich shops |
get on your nerves

\f1:
nothing kills me altogether
\gab{520}
only he [\bloom] thinks he knows a~great lot about a~woman's dress and cooking |
mathering everything he can scour off the shelves into it |
if I~went by his advices every blessed hat I~put on

\f1:
does that suit me

\M1:
yes take that

\m1:
that's alright

\f1:
the one like a~weddingcake standing up miles off my head he said suited me |
or the dishcover one coming down on my backside

\F2:
on pins and needles about the shopgirl |
in that place in Grafton street I~had the misfortune to bring him into |
and she as insolent as ever she could be |
with her smirk |
saying

\M1:
I'm afraid we're giving you too much trouble

\f2:
what she's there for |
but I~stared it out of her

\f2:
yes he [\cuffe] was awfully stiff and no wonder |
but he changed |
the second time he looked

\f2:
Poldy pigheaded as usual |
like the soup

\f2:
but I~could see him [\cuffe] looking very hard at my chest
when he stood up to open the door for me |
\gab{530}
it was nice of him to show me out

\M2:
in any case I'm extremely sorry Mrs Bloom |

when I~unbuttoned him and took his out and drew back the skin

\f1:
it had a~kind of eye in it

\f1:
they're all

\f1:
Buttons |
men down the middle |
on the wrong side of them

\M3:
Molly darling

\F2:
he called me |
what was his name

\f2:
Jack |
Joe |
Harry Mulvey |
was it

\f2:
yes I~think |
a~lieutenant

\f2:
he was rather fair |
he had a~laughing kind of a~voice

\f2:
so I~went round to the whatyoucallit |
everything was whatyoucallit

\f2:
moustache |
had he

\M3:
\gab{820}
he said |
he'd come back

\F2:
Lord it's just like yesterday to me |
and if I~was married |
he'd do it to me |
and I~promised him yes faithfully

\F3:
I'd let him block me now flying |
perhaps he's dead or killed or a~captain or admiral |
it's nearly 20~years |
if I~said firtree cove he would

\f3:
if he came up behind me and put his hands over my eyes to guess who |
I~might recognise him |
he's young still about~40 |
perhaps he's married some girl on the black water |
and is quite changed

\f3:
they all do |
they haven't half the character a~woman has

\f3:
she little knows what I~did with her beloved husband before he ever dreamt of her |
in broad daylight too |
in the sight of the whole world you might say |
they could have put an article about it in the Chronicle

\F4:
\gab{830}
I~was a~bit wild after |
when I~blew out the old bag the biscuits were in |
from Benady Bros |
and exploded it

\f4:
Lord what a~bang |
all the woodcocks and pigeons screaming |

\f4:
coming back the same way that we went |
over middle hill |
round by the old guardhouse and the jews' burialplace |
pretending to read out the Hebrew on them

\f4:
I~wanted to fire his pistol

\M3:
he said he hadn't one |
he didn't know what to make of me

\F4:
with his peak cap on |
that he always wore crooked as often as I~settled it straight |
H~M~S Calypso |
swinging my hat

\F5:
that old Bishop that spoke off the altar |
his [\bishop] long preach about woman's higher functions |
about girls now riding the bicycle and wearing peak caps and the new woman bloomers |
God send him sense and me more money

\f5:
\gab{840}
I~suppose they're called after him [\bloom] |
I~never thought that would be my name Bloom |
when I~used to write it in print to see how it looked on a~visiting card |
or practising for the butcher |
and oblige M~Bloom

\f5:
you're looking blooming Josie [\josie] used to say |
after I~married him

\f5:
well it's better than Breen or Briggs does |
brig or those awful names with bottom in them |
Mrs Ramsbottom or some other kind of a~bottom |
Mulvey I~wouldn't go mad about either |
or suppose I~divorced him [\bloom] |
Mrs Boylan

\f5:
my mother whoever she was |
might have given me a~nicer name the Lord knows |
after the lovely one she had |
Lunita Laredo

\F1:
the fun we had running along Willis's road to Europa point |
twisting in and out all round the other side of Jersey

\f1:
they were shaking and dancing about in my blouse |
\gab{850}
like Milly's little ones now when she runs up the stairs |
I~loved looking down at them

\f1:
I~was jumping up at the pepper trees and the white poplars |
pulling the leaves off and throwing them at him [\mulvey]

\f1:
he went to India |
he was to write

\f1:
the voyages those men have to make to the ends of the world and back |
it's the least they might get a~squeeze or two at a~woman while they can |
going out to be drowned or blown up somewhere

\f1:
I~went up Windmill hill to the flats that Sunday morning |
with captain Rubio's (that was dead) spyglass like the sentry had |
he said he'd have one or two from on board

\f1:
I~wore that frock from the Bon March√© Paris and the coral necklace |
the straits shining |
I~could see over to Morocco almost |
the bay of Tangier white and the Atlas mountain with snow on it |
\gab{860}
and the straits like a~river so clear

\F2:
Harry

\M3:
Molly darling

\F2:
I~was thinking of him on the sea all the time after at mass |
when my petticoat began to slip down at the elevation |
weeks and weeks I~kept the handkerchief under my pillow for the smell of him

\f2:
there was no decent perfume to be got in that Gibraltar |
only that cheap peau d'Espagne that faded and left a~stink on you |
more than anything else I~wanted to give him a~memento

\M3:
he gave me that clumsy Claddagh ring for luck

\M1:
that I~gave Gardner going to south Africa |
where those Boers killed him [\gardner] with their war and fever |
but they were well beaten all the same

\F3:
as if it brought its bad luck with it |
like an opal or pearl |
still it must have been pure 18~carrot gold because it was very heavy |
\gab{870}
but what could you get in a~place like that |
the sandfrog shower from Africa

\f3:
and that derelict ship that came up to the harbour |
Marie |
the Marie whatyoucallit

\f3:
no he [\mulvey] hadn't a~moustache |
that was Gardner |
yes I~can see his face cleanshaven

\M2:
Frseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeefrong

\F3:
that train again

\f3:
weeping tone

\f3:
once in the dear deaead days beyondre call |
close my eyes |
breath my lips |
forward kiss |
sad look |
eyes open |
piano |
ere oer the world the mists began

\f3:
I~hate that

\f3:
istsbeg comes love's sweet sooooooooooong

\F4:
I'll let that out full when I~get in front of the footlights again

\f4:
Kathleen Kearney and her lot of squealers |
Miss This |
Miss That |
Miss Theother |
lot of sparrowfarts skitting around |
talking about politics they know as much about as my backside |
\gab{880}
anything in the world to make themselves someway interesting |
Irish homemade beauties

\f4:
soldier's daughter am~I |
ay |
and whose are you

\f4:
bootmaker's and publican's |
I~beg your pardon coach |
I~thought you were a~wheelbarrow

\f4:
they'd die down dead off their feet |
if ever they got a~chance of walking down the Alameda on an officer's arm |
like me on the bandnight |
my eyes flash |
my bust that they haven't |
passion |
God help their poor head |
I~knew more about men and life when~I was~15 |
than they'll all know at~50 |
they don't know how to sing a~song like that

\M1:
Gardner said no man could look at my mouth and teeth smiling like that |
and not think of it

\F5:
I~was afraid he [\gardner] mightn't like my accent first |
he so English
\gab{890}

\f5:
all father left me in spite of his stamps |
I've my mother's eyes and figure anyhow |
he [\father] always said they're so snotty about themselves |
some of those cads

\M1:
he [\gardner] wasn't a~bit like that |
he was dead gone on my lips

\f5:
let them get a~husband first that's fit to be looked at |
and a~daughter like mine |
or see if they can excite a~swell with money |
that can pick and choose whoever he wants like Boylan |
to do it 4~or~5 times |
locked in each other's arms

\f5:
or the voice either |
I~could have been a~prima donna only I~married him [\bloom]

\F1:
comes loooove's old |
deep down

\f1:
chin back |
not too much |
make it double

\f1:
My Lady's Bower is too long |
for an encore about the moated grange at twilight and vaunted rooms |
yes I'll sing Winds that blow from the south |
that he [\dArcy] gave after the choirstair's performance

\f1:
\gab{900}
I'll change that lace on my black dress to show off my bubs |
and I'll |
yes by God |
I'll get that big fan mended |
make them burst with envy

\F2:
my hole is itching me always when I~think of him [\boylan]

\f2:
I~feel I~want to |
I~feel some wind in me |
better go easy |
not wake him [\bloom]

\f2:
have him at it again |
slobbering after washing every bit of myself |
back belly and sides |
if we had even a~bath itself |
or my own room

\f2:
anyway I~wish he'd sleep in some bed by himself |
with his cold feet on me

\f2:
give us room even to let a~fart |
God |
or do the least thing

\f2:
better yes

\f2:
hold them like that |
a~bit on my side

\f2:
piano quietly

\f2:
sweeeee

\f2:
there's that train far away

\f2:
pianissimo

\f2:
eeeee

\f2:
one more song

\sentence{Milly}


\F3:
that was a~relief |
wherever you be |
let your wind go free

\f3:
who knows if that pork chop I~took with my cup of tea after
\gab{910}
was quite good

\f3:
with the heat I~couldn't smell anything off it

\f3:
I'm sure that queerlooking man in the porkbutcher's is a~great rogue

\f3:
I~hope that lamp is not smoking |
fill my nose up with smuts |
better than having him [\bloom] leaving the gas on all night

\f3:
I~couldn't rest easy in my bed in Gibraltar |
even getting up to see

\f3:
why am I~so damned nervous about that |
though I~like it in the winter |
it's more company

\F4:
O~Lord it was rotten cold too that winter when I~was only about ten |
was~I |
yes |
I~had the big doll with all the funny clothes
dressing her up and undressing |
that icy wind skeeting across from those mountains |
the something Nevada |
sierra nevada

\f4:
standing at the fire |
with the little bit of a~short shift I~had up |
to heat myself |
I~loved dancing about in it |
\gab{920}
then make a~race back into bed

\F5:
I'm sure that fellow opposite used to be there the whole time |
watching with the lights out in the summer |
and~I in~my skin hopping around

\f5:
I~used to love myself then |
stripped at the washstand |
dabbing and creaming

\f5:
only when it came to the chamber performance I~put out the light too |
so then there were 2~of us

\f5:
goodbye to my sleep for this night anyhow

\M1:
I~hope he's [\bloom] not going to get in with those medicals
leading him astray to imagine he's young again |
coming in at 4~in the morning it must be if not more

\m1:
still he had the manners not to wake me

\m1:
what do they find to gabber about all night squandering money
and getting drunker and drunker |
couldn't they drink water

\M2:
then he starts giving us his orders
\gab{930}
for eggs and tea and Findon haddy and hot buttered toast |
I~suppose we'll have him sitting up like the king of the country |
pumping the wrong end of the spoon up and down in his egg |
wherever he learned that from

\m2:
and I~love to hear him falling up the stairs of a~morning
with the cups rattling on the tray |
and then play with the cat

\m2:
she rubs up against you for her own sake |
I~wonder has she fleas |
she's as bad as a~woman |
always licking and lecking |
but I~hate their claws |
I~wonder do they see anything that we can't |
staring like that |
when she sits at the top of the stairs so long |
and listening as I~wait always |
what a~robber too

\F1:
that lovely fresh plaice I~bought |
I~think I'll get a~bit of fish tomorrow |
or today |
is it Friday |
yes I~will

\f1:
with some blancmange with black currant jam like long ago |
\gab{940}
not those 2~lb pots of mixed plum and apple from the London and Newcastle |
Williams and Woods' goes twice as far

\f1:
only for the bones I~hate those eels |
cod |
yes I'll get a~nice piece of cod

\f1:
I'm always getting enough for~3 |
forgetting anyway |
I'm sick of that everlasting butcher's meat from Buckley's |
loin chops and leg beef and rib steak and scrag of mutton and calf's pluck |
the very name is enough

\F2:
or a~picnic |
suppose we all gave 5/-~each and

\f2:
or let him [\boylan] pay it and invite some other woman for him |
who |
Mrs Fleming

\f2:
and drove out to the furry glen or the strawberry beds

\f2:
we'd have him [\bloom] examining all the horse's toenails first |
like he does with the letters

\f2:
no |
not with Boylan there

\F3:
yes |
with some cold veal and ham mixed sandwiches

\f3:
\gab{950}
there are little houses down at the bottom of the banks there

\f3:
on purpose |
but it's as hot as blazes he says

\f3:
not a~bank holiday anyhow |
I~hate those ruck of Mary Ann coalboxes out for the day

\f3:
Whit Monday is a~cursed day too |
no wonder that bee bit him

\M3:
better the seaside |
but I'd never again in this life get into a~boat with him
after him at Bray telling the boatman he knew how to row

\m3:
if anyone asked could he ride the steeplechase for the gold cup |
he'd say yes

\m3:
then it came on to get rough |
the old thing crookeding about and the weight all down my side |
telling me pull the right reins |
now pull the left |
and the tide all swamping in floods in through the bottom |
and his oar slipping out of the stirrup |
it's a~mercy we weren't all drowned

\m3:
\gab{960}
he can swim of course |
me no |

\M1:
there's no danger whatsoever |
keep yourself calm

\m3:
in his flannel trousers |
I'd like to have tattered them down off him
before all the people |
and give him what that one calls flagellate |
till he was black and blue |
do him all the good in the world

\F4:
only for that longnosed chap |
I~don't know who he is |
with that other beauty Burke out of the City Arms hotel |
was there spying around as usual on the slip |
always where he [\burke] wasn't wanted |
if there was a~row on you'd vomit a~better face |
there was no love lost between us |
that's 1~consolation

\f4:
I~wonder what kind is that book he [\bloom] brought me |
Sweets of Sin by a~gentleman of fashion |
some other Mr de Kock I~suppose |
the people gave him [\gentfash] that nickname |
going about with his tube from one woman to another

\f4:
\gab{970}
I~couldn't even change my new white shoes |
all ruined with the saltwater |
and the hat I~had with that feather |
all blowy and tossed on me |
how annoying and provoking

\f4:
because the smell of the sea excited me |
of course the sardines and the bream in Catalan bay
round the back of the rock
they were fine |
all silver in the fishermen's baskets |
old Luigi near a~hundred they said came from Genoa |
and the tall old chap with the earrings |
I~don't like a~man you have to climb up to to get at |
I~suppose they're all dead and rotten long ago

\F5:
besides |
I~don't like being alone in this big barracks of a~place at night |
I~suppose I'll have to put up with it

\f5:
I~never brought a~bit of salt in even when we moved in |
the confusion |
\gab{980}
musical academy he [\bloom] was going to make on the first floor |
drawingroom with a~brassplate |
or Bloom's private hotel he suggested

\M2:
go and ruin himself altogether the way |
his father [\bloomDa] did down in Ennis

\m2:
like all the things he told father [\father] he was going to do |
and me but I~saw through him |
telling me all the lovely places we could go for the honeymoon |
Venice by moonlight with the gondolas and the lake of Como |
he had a~picture cut out of some paper of |
and mandolines and lanterns

\m2:
O~how nice I~said |
whatever I~liked he was going to do immediately if not sooner

\m2:
\song{will you be my man |
will you carry my can}

\F1:
he ought to get a~leather medal with a~putty rim for all the plans he invents

\f1:
then leaving us here all day |
\gab{990}
you'd never know what old beggar at the door for a~crust
with his [\beggar] long story |
might be a~tramp |
and put his foot in the way to prevent me shutting it

\F2:
like that picture of that hardened criminal
he [\criminal] was called in Lloyd's Weekly news |
20~years in jail |
then he comes out and murders an old woman for her money |
imagine his poor wife or mother or whoever she is |
such a~face you'd run miles away from

\f2:
I~couldn't rest easy till I~bolted all the doors and windows to make sure

\f2:
but it's worse again being locked up like in a~prison or a~madhouse

\f2:
they ought to be all shot |
or the cat of nine tails

\f2:
a~big brute like that |
that would attack a~poor old woman to murder her in her bed |
I'd cut them off him so I~would

\M3:
not that he'd [\bloom] be much use |
still better than nothing |
the night I~was sure I~heard burglars in the kitchen |
\gab{1000}
and he went down in his shirt with a~candle and a~poker |
as if he was looking for a~mouse |
as white as a~sheet |
frightened out of his wits |
making as much noise as he possibly could for the burglar's benefit

\F3:
there isn't much to steal indeed the Lord knows |
still it's the feeling especially now with Milly away

\f3:
such an idea for him to send the girl down there to learn to take photographs |
on account of his grandfather |
instead of sending her to Skerry's academy where she'd have to learn

\f3:
not like me getting all~1's at school

\f3:
only he'd do a~thing like that all the same |
on account of me and Boylan |
that's why he did it |
I'm certain the way he plots and plans everything out

\F4:
I~couldn't turn round with her [\milly] in the place lately
unless I~bolted the door first |
\gab{1010}
gave me the fidgets coming in without knocking first |
when I~put the chair against the door |
just as I~was washing myself there below with the glove

\f4:
get on your nerves |
then doing the loglady all day |
put her in a~glasscase with two at a~time to look at her

\f4:
if he knew she broke off the hand off that little gimcrack statue |
with her roughness and carelessness before she left |
that I~got that little Italian boy to mend so that you can't see the join for 2~shillings

\f4:
wouldn't even teem the potatoes for you

\f4:
of course she's right not to ruin her hands

\F5:
I~noticed he was always talking to her lately at the table |
explaining things in the paper |
and she pretending to understand

\f5:
sly of course |
that comes from his side of the house

\f5:
he can't say I~pretend things can he |
\gab{1020}
I'm too honest as a~matter of fact

\f5:
and helping her into her coat

\f5:
but if there was anything wrong with her |
it's me she'd tell not him

\F1:
I~suppose he thinks I'm finished out and laid on the shelf |
well I'm not |
no nor anything like it |
we'll see |
we'll see

\f1:
now she's well on for flirting too with Tom Devan's two sons |
imitating me whistling |
with those romps of Murray girls calling for her

\F2:
can Milly come out please

\f1:
she's in great demand |
to pick what they can out of her |
round in Nelson street riding Harry Devan's bicycle at night

\f1:
it's as well he sent her where she is |
she was just getting out of bounds |
wanting to go on the skatingrink
and smoking their cigarettes through their nose

\f1:
I~smelt it off her dress |
when I was biting off the thread of the button |
I~sewed on to the bottom of her jacket

\f1:
\gab{1030}
she couldn't hide much from me |
I~tell you

\f1:
only I~oughtn't to have stitched it and it on her |
it brings a~parting |
and the last plumpudding too split in 2~halves |
see it comes out no matter what they say

\F2:
her tongue is a~bit too long for my taste

\F5:
[\milly] your blouse is open too low

\F2:
she says to me |
the pan calling the kettle blackbottom

\f2:
and I~had to tell her not to cock her legs up like that |
on show on the windowsill |
before all the people passing

\f2:
they all look at her like me when I~was her age |
of course any old rag looks well on you

\F3:
then a~great touchmenot too in her own way

\f3:
at the Only Way in the Theatre royal

\F5:
[\milly] take your foot away out of that |
I~hate people touching me

\f3:
afraid of her life I'd crush her skirt with the pleats

\F4:
a~lot of that touching must go on in theatres |
in the crush
\gab{1040}
in the dark they're always trying to wiggle up to you

\f4:
that fellow in the pit at the Gaiety for Beerbohm Tree in Trilby

\f4:
the last time I'll ever go there to be squashed like that |
for any Trilby or her barebum

\f4:
every two minutes tipping me there and looking away |
he's [\pitman] a~bit daft I~think |
I~saw him after trying to get near two stylishdressed ladies outside Switzers' window |
at the same little game |
I~recognised him on the moment |
the face and everything |
but he didn't remember me

\F5:
yes and she didn't even want me to kiss her at the Broadstone going away |
well I~hope she'll get someone to dance attendance on her |
the way I~did when she was down with the mumps and her glands swollen |
where's this and where's that

\f5:
\gab{1050}
of course she can't feel anything deep yet |
I~never came properly till~I was |
what |
22~or so |
it went into the wrong place always

\F1:
only the usual girls' nonsense and giggling |
that Conny Connolly writing to her in white ink on black paper sealed with sealingwax

\f1:
though she clapped when the curtain came down because he looked so handsome |
then we had Martin Harvey for breakfast dinner and supper

\f1:
I~thought to myself afterwards it must be real love |
if a~man gives up his life for her that way for nothing |
I~suppose there are a~few men like that left

\f1:
it's hard to believe in it though unless it really happened to me |
the majority of them with not a~particle of love in their natures

\f1:
to find two people like that nowadays full up of each other |
\gab{1060}
that would feel the same way as you do |
they're usually a~bit foolish in the head

\f1:
his father [\bloomDa] must have been a~bit queer
to go and poison himself after her [\bloomMa] |
still poor old man |
I~suppose he felt lost

\F2:
she's [\milly] always making love to my things too |
the few old rags I~have |
wanting to put her hair up at~15 |
my powder too |
only ruin her skin on her |
she's time enough for that |
all her life after

\f2:
of course she's restless |
knowing she's pretty |
with her lips so red |
a~pity they won't stay that way

\f2:
I~was too |
but there's no use going to the fair with the thing

\f2:
answering me like a~fishwoman when I~asked to go for~a half~a stone of potatoes

\f2:
the day we met Mrs Joe Gallaher at the trottingmatches |
and she [\mrsjoeg] pretended not to see us in her trap with Friery the solicitor |
we weren't grand enough

\f2:
\gab{1070}
till I~gave her [\milly] 2~damn fine cracks across the ear for herself |
take that now for answering me like that |
and that for your impudence |
she had me that exasperated |
of course contradicting

\f2:
I~was badtempered too because |
how was it |
there was a~weed in the tea or I~didn't sleep the night before |
cheese I~ate was it

\F3:
and I~told her over and over again not to leave knives crossed like that

\f3:
because she has nobody to command her as she said herself

\f3:
well if he [\bloom] doesn't correct her |
faith I~will |
that was the last time she turned on the teartap

\f3:
I~was just like that myself |
they daren't order me about the place

\F4:
it's his fault of course |
having the two of us slaving here instead of getting in a~woman long ago

\f4:
am I~ever going to have a~proper servant again

\f4:
\gab{1080}
of course then she'd see him coming |
I'd have to let her know or she'd revenge it

\f4:
aren't they a~nuisance |
that old Mrs Fleming |
you have to be walking round after her [\mrsfleming]
putting the things into her hands |
sneezing and farting into the pots |
well of course she's old |
she can't help it

\f4:
a~good job I~found that rotten old smelly dishcloth that got lost behind the dresser |
I~knew there was something and opened the area window to let out the smell

\F5:
bringing in his [\bloom] friends to entertain them

\f5:
like the night he walked home with a~dog |
if you please |
that might have been mad

\M1:
especially Simon Dedalus' son

\m1:
his [\stephen] father such a~criticiser |
with his [\simon] glasses up |
with his tall hat on him at the cricket match |
and a~great big hole in his sock |
one thing laughing at the other

\m1:
\gab{1090}
and his son [\stephen] that got all those prizes
for whatever he won them in the intermediate

\F1:
imagine climbing over the railings |
if anybody saw him [\bloom] that knew us

\f1:
I~wonder he didn't tear a~big hole in his grand funeral trousers |
as if the one nature gave wasn't enough for anybody

\M1:
hawking him [\stephen] down into the dirty old kitchen

\f1:
now is he [\bloom] right in his head |
I~ask

\F2:
pity it wasn't washing day |
my old pair of drawers might have been hanging up too on the line |
on exhibition for all he'd ever care

\f2:
with the ironmould mark the stupid old bundle [\mrsfleming] burned on them

\M1:
he [\stephen] might think was something else

\F3:
and she [\mrsfleming] never even rendered down the fat I~told her |
and now she's going such as she was |
on account of her paralysed husband getting worse |
\gab{1100}
there's always something wrong with them |
disease or they have to go under an operation |
or if it's not that it's drink and he beats her |
I'll have to hunt around again for someone

\F4:
every day I~get up there's some new thing on |
sweet God sweet God |
well when I'm stretched out dead in my grave |
I~suppose I'll have some peace |
I~want to get up a~minute if I'm let

\F5:
wait |
O~Jesus |
wait |
yes |
that thing has come on me |
yes |
now wouldn't that afflict you

\f5:
of course |
all the poking and rooting and ploughing
he [\boylan] had up in me |
now what am~I to do |
Friday |
Saturday |
Sunday |
wouldn't that pester the soul out of a~body

\f5:
unless he likes it |
some men do |
God knows there's always something wrong with us |
5~days every 3~or~4 weeks |
usual monthly auction isn't it

\F1:
\gab{1110}
simply sickening that night it came on me like that

\f1:
the one and only time we were in a~box |
that Michael Gunn gave him [\bloom] |
to see Mrs Kendal and her husband at the Gaiety

\f1:
something he [\bloom] did about insurance for him [\gunn] in Drimmie's

\f1:
I~was fit to be tied |
though I~wouldn't give in

\f1:
with that gentleman of fashion staring down at me with his glasses |
and him [\bloom] the other side of me |
talking about Spinoza and his soul that's dead |
I~suppose millions of years ago

\f1:
I~smiled the best I~could |
all in a~swamp |
leaning forward as if I~was interested |
having to sit it out then to the last tag

\f1:
I~won't forget that wife of Scarli in a~hurry |
supposed to be a~fast play about adultery

\F2:
that idiot in the gallery hissing |
the woman adulteress he [\idiot] shouted |
I~suppose he went and had a~woman in the next lane |
\gab{1120}
running round all the back ways after to make up for it

\f2:
I~wish he had what I~had |
then he'd boo

\F3:
I~bet the cat itself is better off than us |
have we too much blood up in us or what

\f3:
O~patience above |
it's pouring out of me like the sea

\f3:
anyhow he [\boylan] didn't make me pregnant as big as he is

\f3:
I~don't want to ruin the clean sheets I~just put on |
I~suppose the clean linen I~wore brought it on too

\f3:
damn it |
damn it

\F4:
and they always want to see a~stain on the bed to know you're a~virgin for them |
all that's troubling them |
they're such fools too |
you could be a~widow or divorced 40~times over |
a~daub of red ink would do or blackberry juice |
no |
that's too purply

\f4:
O~Jamesy |
let me up out of this |
pooh |
sweets of sin |
whoever suggested that business for women |
\gab{1130}
what between clothes and cooking and children

\f4:
this damned old bed too |
jingling like the dickens |
I~suppose they could hear us away over the other side of the park |
till I~suggested to put the quilt on the floor with the pillow under my bottom

\F5:
I~wonder is it nicer in the day |
I~think it is

\f5:
easy

\f5:
I~think I'll cut all this hair off me there scalding me |
I~might look like a~young girl

\f5:
wouldn't he [\boylan] get the great suckin
the next time he turned up my clothes on me |
I'd give anything to see his face

\F1:
where's the chamber gone |
easy

\f1:
I've a~holy horror of its breaking under me after that old commode

\f1:
I~wonder was~I too heavy sitting on his knee |
I~made him sit on the easychair purposely |
when I~took off only my blouse and skirt first in the other room |
he was so busy where he oughtn't to be he never felt me |
\gab{1140}
I~hope my breath was sweet after those kissing comfits

\f1:
easy |
God I~remember one time I~could scout it out straight whistling like a~man almost |
easy

\f1:
O~Lord how noisy |
I~hope they're bubbles on it |
for a~wad of money from some fellow

\f1:
I'll have to perfume it in the morning |
don't forget

\F2:
I~bet he never saw a~better pair of thighs than that |
look how white they are |
the smoothest place is right there between this bit here |
how soft like a~peach

\f2:
easy

\f2:
God I~wouldn't mind being a~man and get up on a~lovely woman |
O~Lord what a~row you're making |
like the jersey lily

\f2:
easy |
easy

\f2:
O~how the waters come down at Lahore

is there anything the matter with my insides |
or have~I something growing in me |
\gab{1150}
getting that thing like that every week

\f3:
when was it last~I |
Whit Monday |
yes it's only about 3~weeks

\F4:
I~ought to go to the doctor |
only it would be like before I~married him [\bloom] |
when I~had that white thing coming from me |
and Floey made me go to that dry old stick Dr Collins
for women's diseases on Pembroke road

\M1:
[\collins] your vagina

\f4:
he called it |
I~suppose that's how he got all the gilt mirrors and carpets |
getting round those rich ones off Stephen's green |
running up to him for every little fiddlefaddle |
her vagina and her cochinchina |
they've money of course so they're all right

\f4:
I~wouldn't marry him |
not if he was the last man in the world

\f4:
besides |
there's something queer about their children

\f4:
always smelling around those filthy bitches all sides |
asking me if what I~did had an offensive odour |
\gab{1160}
what did he want me to do but the one thing

\M1:
gold

\f4:
maybe

\f4:
what a~question

\f4:
if I~smathered it all over his wrinkly old face for him
with all my compriments |
I~suppose he'd know then

\M1:
and could you pass it easily

\f4:
pass what

\f4:
I~thought he was talking about the rock of Gibraltar the way he put it

\F5:
that's a~very nice invention too by the way only |
I~like letting myself down after in the hole |
as far as I~can squeeze and pull the chain then to flush it |
nice cool pins and needles

\f5:
still there's something in it I~suppose |
I~always used to know by Milly's |
when she was a~child |
whether she had worms or not |
still all the same |
paying him for that

\F5:
how much is that doctor

\M1:
one guinea please

\f5:
and asking me had~I frequent omissions |
\gab{1170}
where do those old fellows get all the words they have

\M1:
omissions

\f5:
with his shortsighted eyes on me cocked sideways |
I~wouldn't trust him too far to give me chloroform or God knows what else

\f5:
still I~liked him when he sat down to write the thing out |
frowning so severe |
his nose intelligent

\F1:
like that you be damned you lying strap |
O~anything no matter who except an idiot |
he [\bloom] was clever enough to spot that

\f1:
of course that was all thinking of him and his mad crazy letters

\M2:
my Precious one |
everything connected with your glorious Body |
everything underlined |
that comes from it |
is a~thing of beauty and of joy for ever

\f1:
something he got out of some nonsensical book that he had

\f1:
me always at myself 4~and~5 times a~day sometimes |
and I~said I~hadn't

\M2:
\gab{1180}
are you sure

\f1:
O~yes I~said |
I~am quite sure |
in a~way that shut him up |
I~knew what was coming next |
only natural weakness it was |
he excited me

\F2:
I~don't know how the first night ever we met |
when I~was living in Rehoboth terrace |
we stood staring at one another for about 10~minutes |
as if we met somewhere |
I~suppose on account of my being jewess looking after my mother

\f2:
he used to amuse me the things he said |
with the half sloothering smile on him |
and all the Doyles said he was going to stand for a~member of Parliament

\f2:
O~wasn't~I the born fool
to believe all his blather about home rule and the land league |
sending me that long strool of a~song out of the Huguenots |
to sing in French to be more classy |
\french{O~beau pays de la Touraine} |
that I~never even sang once |
\gab{1190}
explaining and rigmaroling about religion and persecution

\F3:
he won't let you enjoy anything naturally

then might~I as a~great favour

\F3:
the very 1st~opportunity he got a~chance |
in Brighton square |
running into my bedroom pretending the ink got on his hands |
to wash it off with the Albion milk and sulphur soap I~used to use |
and the gelatine still round it

\f3:
O~I~laughed myself sick at him that day

\F4:
I~better not make an alnight sitting on this affair |
they ought to make chambers a~natural size |
so that a~woman could sit on it properly

\f4:
he kneels down to do it |
I~suppose there isn't in all creation another man with the habits he has |
look at the way he's sleeping at the foot of the bed |
how can he without a~hard bolster |
it's well he doesn't kick
\gab{1200}
or he might knock out all my teeth

\f4:
breathing with his hand on his nose |
like that Indian god [\buddha] he took me to show one wet Sunday |
in the museum in Kildare street |
all yellow in a~pinafore |
lying on his side on his hand with his ten toes sticking out |
that he [\bloom] said was a~bigger religion
than the jews and Our Lord's |
both put together |
all over Asia |
imitating him as he's always imitating everybody

\f4:
I~suppose he [\buddha] used to sleep at the foot of the bed too |
with his big square feet up in his wife's mouth

\F5:
damn this stinking thing anyway |
where's this those napkins are |
ah yes I~know |
I~hope the old press doesn't creak |
ah I~knew it would

\f5:
he's [\bloom] sleeping hard |
had a~good time somewhere |
still she must have given him great value for his money |
of course he has to pay for it from her

\f5:
\gab{1210}
O~this nuisance of a~thing |
I~hope they'll have something better for us in the other world |
tying ourselves up |
God help us |
that's all right for tonight

\F1:
now the lumpy old jingly bed always reminds me of old Cohen |
I~suppose he [\cohen] scratched himself in it often enough

\f1:
and he [\bloom] thinks father bought it from Lord Napier |
that I~used to admire when I~was a~little girl |
because I~told him

\f1:
easy |
piano |
O~I~like my bed

\F2:
God here we are as bad as ever after 16~years |
how many houses were we in at all |
Raymond terrace and Ontario terrace and Lombard street and Holles street |
and he goes about whistling every time we're on the run again |
his huguenots or the frogs' march |
pretending to help the men with our 4~sticks of furniture

\f2:
and then the City Arms hotel |
\gab{1220}
worse and worse says Warden Daly |
that charming place on the landing |
always somebody inside praying |
then leaving all their stinks after them |
always know who was in there last

\f2:
every time we're just getting on right |
something happens or he puts his big foot in it |
Thom's and Hely's and Mr Cuffe's and Drimmie's |
either he's [\bloom] going to be run into prison over his old lottery tickets |
that was to be all our salvations |
or he goes and gives impudence

\f2:
we'll have him coming home with the sack soon
out of the Freeman too |
like the rest |
on account of those Sinner Fein or the freemasons

\f2:
then we'll see if the little man [\griffith] he showed me |
dribbling along in the wet all by himself round by Coady's lane |
will give him much consolation |
that he says is so capable and sincerely Irish |
he is indeed
\gab{1230}
judging by the sincerity of the trousers I~saw on him

\F3:
wait |
there's George's church bells |
wait |
3~quarters |
the hour |
1~wait |
2~oclock

\f3:
well that's a~nice hour of the night for him [\bloom] to be coming home at |
to anybody climbing down into the area if anybody saw him |
I'll knock him off that little habit tomorrow

\F4:
first I'll look at his shirt to see |
or I'll see if he has that French letter still in his pocketbook |
I~suppose he thinks I~don't know |
deceitful men |
all their 20~pockets aren't enough for their lies |
then why should we tell them |
even if it's the truth they don't believe you

\f4:
then tucked up in bed |
like those babies in the Aristocrat's Masterpiece he brought me another time |
as if we hadn't enough of that in real life |
without some old Aristocrat or whatever his name is |
\gab{1240}
disgusting you more with those rotten pictures |
children with two heads and no legs |
that's the kind of villainy they're always dreaming about |
with not another thing in their empty heads |
they ought to get slow poison the half of them

\f4:
then tea and toast for him |
buttered on both sides |
and newlaid eggs I~suppose

\F5:
I'm nothing any more |
when I~wouldn't let him lick me in Holles street one night

\f5:
man |
man |
tyrant as ever for the one thing |
he slept on the floor half the night naked |
the way the jews used when somebody dies belonged to them |
and wouldn't eat any breakfast or speak a~word |
wanting to be petted

\f5:
so I~thought I~stood out enough for one time and let him |
he does it all wrong too |
thinking only of his own pleasure |
\gab{1250}
his tongue is too flat or I~don't know what |
he forgets that |
wethen I~don't |
I'll make him do it again if he doesn't mind himself |
and lock him down to sleep in the coalcellar with the blackbeetles

\F1:
I~wonder was it her |
Josie [\josie] off her head with my castoffs |
he's such a~born liar too |
no he'd never have the courage with a~married woman |
that's why he wants me and Boylan |
though as for her Denis as she calls him [\breen] |
that forlornlooking spectacle |
you couldn't call him a~husband

\f1:
yes it's some little bitch he's [\bloom] got in with |
even when I~was with him with Milly at the College races

\f1:
that Hornblower with the child's bonnet on the top of his nob |
let us into by the back way

\f1:
he was throwing his sheep's eyes at those two doing skirt duty up and down |
I~tried to wink at him first |
\gab{1260}
no use of course |
and that's the way his money goes

\F2:
this is the fruits of Mr Paddy Dignam |
yes they were all in great style at the grand funeral
in the paper Boylan brought in

\f2:
if they saw a~real officer's funeral that'd be something |
reversed arms |
muffled drums |
the poor horse walking behind in black

\f2:
L~Boom and Tom Kernan |
that drunken little barrelly man that bit his tongue off |
falling down the men's W~C drunk |
in some place or other |
and Martin Cunningham and the two Dedaluses and Fanny M'Coy's husband

\f2:
white head of cabbage |
skinny thing [\fanny] with a~turn in her eye |
trying to sing my songs |
she'd want to be born all over again |
and her old green dress with the lowneck |
as she can't attract them any other way |
like dabbling on a~rainy day

\f2:
\gab{1270}
I~see it all now plainly |
and they call that friendship |
killing and then burying one another |
and they all with their wives and families at home

\f2:
more especially Jack Power keeping that barmaid he [\power] does |
of course his wife is always sick or going to be sick or just getting better of it |
and he's a~goodlooking man still |
though he's getting a~bit grey over the ears

\f2:
they're a~nice lot all of them |
well they're not going to get my husband again into their clutches
if I~can help it |
making fun of him [\bloom] then behind his back |
I~know well when he goes on with his idiotics |
because he has sense enough
not to squander every penny piece he earns down their gullets |
and looks after his wife and family |
goodfornothings

\F3:
poor Paddy Dignam |
all the same I'm sorry in a~way for him [\dignam] |
\gab{1280}
what are his wife and 5~children going to do |
unless he was insured |
comical little teetotum always stuck up in some pub corner |
and her [\mrsdignam] or her son waiting

\f3:
\song{Bill Bailey won't you please come home}

\f3:
her widow's weeds won't improve her appearance

\f3:
they're awfully becoming though |
if you're goodlooking

\M2:
what men |
wasn't he |
yes he was at the Glencree dinner |
and Ben Dollard base barreltone |
the night he [\dollard] borrowed the swallowtail to sing out of in Holles street |
squeezed and squashed into them |
and grinning all over his big Dolly face like a~wellwhipped child's botty

\m2:
didn't he look a~balmy ballocks |
sure enough that must have been a~spectacle on the stage |
imagine paying~5/- in the preserved seats for that |
to see him trotting off in his trowlers

\M3:
\gab{1290}
and Simon Dedalus too |
he [\simon] was always turning up half screwed |
singing the second verse first |
\song{the old love is the new} was one of his |
\song{so sweetly sang the maiden on the hawthorn bough}

\m3:
he was always on for flirtyfying too |
when I~sang Maritana with him at Freddy Mayer's private opera |
he had a~delicious glorious voice |
\song{Phoebe dearest goodbye \emph{sweet}heart} |
sweetheart he always sang it |
not like Bartell d'Arcy |
sweet-tart goodbye |
of course he had the gift of the voice |
so there was no art in it

\m3:
all over you like a~warm showerbath

\m3:
\song{O~Maritana wildwood flower} |
we sang splendidly
though it was a~bit too high for my register |
even transposed

\m3:
and he was married at the time to May Goulding |
but then he'd say or do something to knock the good out of it |
\gab{1300}
he's a~widower now

\m3:
I~wonder what sort is his son [\stephen]

\M1:
he [\bloom] says he's [\stephen] an author
and going to be a~university professor of Italian |
and I'm to take lessons |
what is he [\bloom] driving at now |
showing him [\stephen] my photo |
it's not good of me |
I~ought to have got it taken in drapery that never looks out of fashion |
still I~look young in it |
I~wonder he [\bloom] didn't make him [\stephen] a~present of it altogether |
and me too |
after all why not

\m1:
I~saw him [\stephen] driving down to the Kingsbridge station
with his father [\simon] and mother

\F4:
I~was in mourning |
that's 11~years ago now

\f4:
yes he'd [\rudy] be~11

\f4:
though what was the good in going into mourning |
for what was neither one thing nor the other |
the first cry was enough for me |
I~heard the deathwatch too ticking in the wall

\f4:
of course he [\bloom] insisted he'd go into mourning for the cat
\gab{1310}

\M2:
I~suppose he's [\stephen] a~man now by this time |
he was an innocent boy then |
and a~darling little fellow in his lord Fauntleroy suit |
and curly hair like a~prince on the stage |
when I~saw him at Mat Dillon's |
he liked me too I~remember |
they all do

\F5:
wait |
by God |
yes |
wait |
yes |
hold on |
he was on the cards this morning when I~laid out the deck |
union with a~young stranger neither dark nor fair you met before

\f5:
I~thought it meant him [\boylan] but he's no chicken nor a~stranger either |
besides |
my face was turned the other way

\f5:
what was the 7th~card after |
that the 10~of spades for a~journey by land |
then there was a~letter on its way and scandals too |
the 3~queens and the 8~of diamonds for a~rise in society |
yes |
wait |
it all came out |
and 2~red~8's for new garments |
look at that

\f5:
\gab{1320}
and didn't~I dream something too |
yes |
there was something about poetry in it

\M2:
I~hope he [\stephen] hasn't long greasy hair hanging into his eyes |
or standing up like a~red Indian |
what do they go about like that for |
only getting themselves and their poetry laughed at

\F1:
I~always liked poetry when~I was a~girl

\f1:
first I~thought he [\bloom] was a~poet like lord Byron |
and not an ounce of it in his composition |
I~thought he was quite different

\f1:
I~wonder is he [\stephen] too young |
he's about |
wait |
88 |
I~was married~88 |
Milly is~15 yesterday |
89 |
what age was he then at Dillon's |
5~or~6 bout |
88 |
I~suppose he's 20~or more

\F2:
I'm not too old for him if he's 23~or~24 |
I~hope he's not that stuckup university student sort |
no |
otherwise he wouldn't go sitting down
in the old kitchen with him [\bloom] taking Epps's cocoa
\gab{1330}
and talking

\f2:
of course he [\bloom] pretended to understand it all |
probably he told him he was out of Trinity college

\f2:
he's [\stephen] very young to be a~professor

\f2:
I~hope he's not a~professor like Goodwin was |
he [\goodwin] was a~potent professor of John Jameson

\M2:
they all write about some woman in their poetry |
well I~suppose he [\stephen] won't find many like me |
where softly sighs of love the light guitar |
where poetry is in the air |
the blue sea and the moon shining so beautifully

\F3:
coming back on the nightboat from Tarifa |
the lighthouse at Europa point |
the guitar that fellow played was so expressive |
will I~ever go back there again |
all new faces |
\song{two glancing eyes a~lattice hid}

\f3:
I'll sing that for him |
they're my eyes if he's anything of a~poet |
\song{two eyes as darkly bright as love's own star} |
\gab{1340}
aren't those beautiful words |
\song{as love's young star} |
it'll be a~change |
the Lord knows |
to have an intelligent person to talk to about yourself

\f3:
not always listening to him [\bloom] and Billy Prescott's ad
and Keyes's ad and Tom the Devil's ad |
then if anything goes wrong in their business |
we have to suffer

\F4:
I'm sure he's [\stephen] very distinguished |
I'd like to meet a~man like that |
God |
not those other ruck |
besides |
he's young

\f4:
those fine young men I~could see down in Margate strand bathingplace |
from the side of the rock |
standing up in the sun naked like a~God or something |
and then plunging into the sea with them

\f4:
why aren't all men like that |
there'd be some consolation for a~woman

\F5:
like that lovely little statue he [\bloom] bought

\f5:
I~could look at him [\statue] all day long |
\gab{1350}
curly head and his shoulders |
his finger up for you to listen |
there's real beauty and poetry for you |
I~often felt I~wanted to kiss him all over

\f5:
also his lovely young cock there so simple |
I~wouldn't mind taking him in my mouth if nobody was looking |
as if it was asking you to suck it |
so clean and white he looks with his boyish face |
I~would too in 1/2~a minute even if some of it went down |
what it's only like gruel or the dew |
there's no danger |
besides |
he'd be so clean

\f5:
compared with those pigs of men I~suppose never dream of washing it |
from 1~year's end to the other |
the most of them |
only that's what gives the women the moustaches

\F1:
I'm sure it'll be grand if I~can only get in with a~handsome young poet at my age

\f1:
I'll throw them [\cards] the 1st~thing in the morning |
\gab{1360}
till I~see if the wishcard comes out |
or I'll try pairing the lady herself |
and see if he [\stephen] comes out

\f1:
I'll read and study all I~can find |
or learn a~bit off by heart if I~knew who he likes |
so he won't think me stupid |
if he thinks all women are the same |
and I~can teach him the other part |
I'll make him feel all over him |
till he half faints under me |
then he'll write about me |
lover and mistress |
publicly too |
with our 2~photographs in all the papers when he becomes famous

\F2:
O~but then what am~I going to do about him [\boylan] though


% 8
\sentence{Yes}


\F3:
no |
that's no way for him [\boylan]

\f3:
has he no manners nor no refinement nor no nothing in his nature |
slapping us behind like that on my bottom because I~didn't call him Hugh

\f3:
\gab{1370}
the ignoramus that doesn't know poetry from a~cabbage

\f3:
that's what you get for not keeping them in their proper place

\f3:
pulling off his shoes and trousers there on the chair before me |
so barefaced without even asking permission |
and standing out that vulgar way |
in the half of a~shirt they wear |
to be admired like a~priest or a~butcher |
or those old hypocrites in the time of Julius Caesar

\f3:
of course he's right enough in his way to pass the time as a~joke

\f3:
sure you might as well be in bed with |
what |
with a~lion |
God I'm sure he'd have something better to say for himself an old Lion would

\f3:
O~well I~suppose it's because they were so plump and tempting in my short petticoat |
he couldn't resist |
they excite myself sometimes |
it's well for men all the amount of pleasure they get off a~woman's body |
\gab{1380}
we're so round and white for them always

\F4:
I~wished I~was one myself for a~change |
just to try with that thing they have |
swelling up on you so hard |
and at the same time so soft when you touch it

\M1:
my uncle John has a~thing long

\f4:
I~heard those cornerboys saying |
passing the corner of Marrowbone lane

\m1:
my aunt Mary has a~thing hairy

\f4:
because it was dark and they knew a~girl was passing |
it didn't make me blush |
why should it either |
it's only nature

\m1:
and he puts his thing long into my aunt Mary's hairy |
etcetera

\f4:
and turns out to be |
you put the handle in a~sweepingbrush

\F5:
men again all over |
they can pick and choose what they please |
a~married woman or a~fast widow or a~girl for their different tastes |
like those houses round behind Irish street

\f5:
\gab{1390}
no but we're to be always chained up |
they're not going to be chaining me up |
no damn fear |
once I~start I~tell you |
for their stupid husbands' jealousy

\f5:
why can't we all remain friends over it |
instead of quarrelling

\f5:
her husband found it out what they did together |
well naturally |
and if he did
can he undo it

\f5:
he's coronado anyway |
whatever he does |
and then he going to the other mad extreme about the wife in Fair Tyrants

\f5:
of course the man never even casts a~2nd~thought
on the husband or wife either |
it's the woman he wants and he gets her

\F1:
what else were we given all those desires for |
I'd like to know |
I~can't help it if I'm young still |
can~I

\f1:
it's a~wonder I'm not an old shrivelled hag before my time |
living with him [\bloom] so cold |
\gab{1400}
never embracing me except sometimes when he's asleep |
the wrong end of me |
not knowing I~suppose who he has

\f1:
any man that'd kiss a~woman's bottom |
I'd throw my hat at him after that

\f1:
he'd kiss anything unnatural
where we haven't 1~atom of any kind of expression in us |
all of us the same 2~lumps of lard

\f1:
before ever I'd do that to a~man |
pfooh the dirty brutes |
the mere thought is enough

\M3:
I~kiss the feet of you |
senorita

\f1:
there's some sense in that

\F2:
didn't he kiss our halldoor

\f2:
yes he did |
what a~madman

\f2:
nobody understands his cracked ideas but me

\f2:
still of course a~woman wants to be embraced 20~times a~day |
almost to make her look young |
no matter by who |
so long as to be in love or loved by somebody |
if the fellow you want isn't there

\F3:
\gab{1410}
sometimes by the Lord God I~was thinking |
would~I go around by the quays there some dark evening |
where nobody'd know me and pick up a~sailor off the sea |
that'd be hot on for it and not care a~pin whose I~was |
only do it off up in a~gate somewhere

\f3:
or one of those wildlooking gipsies in Rathfarnham |
had their camp pitched near the Bloomfield laundry |
to try and steal our things if they could

\f3:
I~only sent mine there a~few times for the name |
model laundry sending me back over and over some old one's odd stockings

\f3:
that blackguardlooking fellow with the fine eyes peeling a~switch |
attack me in the dark and ride me up against the wall without a~word |
or a~murderer |
anybody

\F4:
what they do themselves |
the fine gentlemen in their silk hats |
\gab{1420}
that K~C lives up somewhere this way |
coming out of Hardwicke lane

\f4:
the night he [\boylan] gave us the fish supper
on account of winning over the boxing match |
of course it was for me he gave it

\f4:
I~knew him [\kc] by his gaiters and the walk |
and when I~turned round a~minute after |
just to see |
there was a~woman after coming out of it too |
some filthy prostitute |
then he goes home to his wife after that

\f4:
only I~suppose the half of those sailors are rotten again with disease

\F5:
O~move over your big carcass out of that |
for the love of Mike |
listen to him [\bloom] |
the winds that waft my sighs to thee |
so well he may sleep and sigh |
the great Suggester Don Poldo de la Flora

\f5:
if he knew how he came out on the cards this morning |
he'd have something to sigh for |
a~dark man in some perplexity |
between two~7's too |
in prison
\gab{1430}
for Lord knows what |
he does that |
I~don't know

\f5:
and I'm to be slooching around down in the kitchen |
to get his lordship his breakfast while he's rolled up like a~mummy |
will~I indeed |
did you ever see me running |
I'd just like to see myself at it

\F1:
show them attention and they treat you like dirt |
I~don't care what anybody says |
it'd be much better for the world to be governed by the women in it |
you wouldn't see women going and killing one another and slaughtering

\f1:
when do you ever see women rolling around drunk like they do |
or gambling every penny they have and losing it on horses

\f1:
yes because a~woman |
whatever she does |
she knows where to stop

\f1:
sure they wouldn't be in the world at all
only for us |
they don't know what it is to be a~woman and a~mother |
\gab{1440}
how could they |
where would they all of them be |
if they hadn't all a~mother to look after them |
what I~never had

\F2:
that's why I~suppose he's [\stephen] running wild now out at night |
away from his books and studies and not living at home |
on account of the usual rowy house I~suppose

\f2:
well it's a~poor case that those that have a~fine son like that |
they're not satisfied |
and I~none

\f2:
was he [\bloom] not able to make one

\f2:
it wasn't my fault

\f2:
we came together when I~was watching the two dogs |
up in her behind in the middle of the naked street

\f2:
that disheartened me altogether |
I~suppose I~oughtn't to have buried him [\rudy]
in that little woolly jacket I~knitted |
crying as I~was |
but give it to some poor child |
but I~knew well I'd never have another |
\gab{1450}
our 1st~death too it was |
we were never the same since

\f2:
O~I'm not going to think myself into the glooms about that any more

\F3:
I~wonder why he [\stephen] wouldn't stay the night

\f3:
I~felt all the time it was somebody strange he [\bloom] brought in

\f3:
instead of roving around the city meeting God knows who |
nightwalkers and pickpockets |
his [\stephen] poor mother wouldn't like that if she was alive |
ruining himself for life perhaps

\f3:
still it's a~lovely hour |
so silent |
I~used to love coming home after dances |
the air of the night

\f3:
they [\men] have friends they can talk to |
we've none |
either he wants what he won't get |
or it's some woman ready to stick her knife in you

\f3:
I~hate that in women |
no wonder they treat us the way they do |
we are a~dreadful lot of bitches |
I~suppose it's all the troubles we have makes us so snappy |
\gab{1460}
I'm not like that

\F4:
he [\stephen] could easy have slept in there on the sofa in the other room |
I~suppose he was as shy as a~boy |
he being so young |
hardly~20 |
of me in the next room |
he'd have heard me on the chamber |
arrah what harm

\f4:
Dedalus |
I~wonder it's like those names in Gibraltar |
Delapaz |
Delagracia |
they had the devil's queer names there |
father Vilaplana of Santa Maria that gave me the rosary |
Rosales y O'Reilly in the Calle las Siete Revueltas |
and Pisimbo

\f4:
and Mrs Opisso in Governor street |
O what a~name |
I'd go and drown myself in the first river if I~had a~name like her

\f4:
O~my and all the bits of streets |
Paradise ramp and Bedlam ramp and Rodger's ramp and Crutchett's ramp |
and the devil's gap steps

\f4:
well small blame to me if I~am a~harumscarum |
\gab{1470}
I~know I~am a~bit |
I~declare to God I~don't feel a~day older than then

\f4:
I~wonder could~I get my tongue round any of the Spanish |
\spanish{como esta usted muy bien gracias y usted} |
see I~haven't forgotten it all |
I~thought I~had only for the grammar

\f4:
a~noun is the name of any person place or thing

\f4:
pity I~never tried to read that novel cantankerous Mrs Rubio lent me |
by Valera with the questions in it all upside down the two ways

\f4:
I~always knew we'd go away in the end

\F5:
I~can tell him [\stephen] the Spanish and he tell me the Italian |
then he'll see I'm not so ignorant |
what a~pity he didn't stay |
I'm sure the poor fellow was dead tired and wanted a~good sleep badly |
I~could have brought him in his breakfast in bed with a~bit of toast |
so long as I~didn't do it on the knife for bad luck |
\gab{1480}
or if the woman was going her rounds with the watercress and something nice and tasty |
there are a~few olives in the kitchen he might like

\f5:
I~never could bear the look of them in Abrines

\f5:
I~could do the criada

\f5:
the room looks all right since I~changed it the other way

\f5:
you see something was telling me all the time I'd have to introduce myself |
not knowing me from Adam

\f5:
very funny wouldn't it |
I'm his wife

\f5:
or pretend we were in Spain with him [\stephen] half awake
without a~God's notion where he is

\f5:
\spanish{dos huevos estrellados se√±or} |
Lord the cracked things come into my head sometimes

\F1:
it'd be great fun |
supposing he stayed with us |
why not |
there's the room upstairs empty and Milly's bed in the back room |
he could do his writing and studies at the table in there |
\gab{1490}
for all the scribbling he [\bloom] does at it

\f1:
and if he [\stephen] wants to read in bed in the morning like me

\f1:
as he's [\bloom] making the breakfast for~1 |
he can make it for~2 |
I'm sure I'm not going to take in lodgers off the street for him |
if he takes a~gesabo of a~house like this

\f1:
I'd love to have a~long talk with an intelligent welleducated person

\f1:
I'd have to get a~nice pair of red slippers |
like those Turks with the fez used to sell |
or yellow |
and a~nice semitransparent morning gown that I~badly want |
or a~peachblossom dressing jacket |
like the one long ago in Walpole's |
only~8/6 or~18/6

\F2:
I'll just give him [\bloom] one more chance

\f2:
I'll get up early in the morning |
I'm sick of Cohen's old bed |
in any case I~might go over to the markets
to see all the vegetables and cabbages and tomatoes and carrots |
\gab{1500}
and all kinds of splendid fruits |
all coming in lovely and fresh

\f2:
who knows who'd be the 1st~man I'd meet |
they're out looking for it in the morning |
Mamy Dillon used to say they are |
and the night too |
that was her massgoing

\f2:
I'd love a~big juicy pear now to melt in your mouth |
like when I~used to be in the longing way

\f2:
then I'll throw him [\stephen] up his eggs and tea

\f2:
in the moustachecup she [\milly] gave him [\bloom] to make his mouth bigger

\f2:
I~suppose he'd [\stephen] like my nice cream too

\F3:
I~know what I'll do |
I'll go about rather gay |
not too much |
singing a~bit now and then |
\italian{mi fa pieta Masetto} |
then I'll start dressing myself to go out |
\italian{presto non son piu forte}

\f3:
I'll put on my best shift and drawers |
let him have a~good eyeful out of that to make his micky stand for him

\f3:
\gab{1510}
I'll let him [\bloom] know if that's what he wanted |
that his wife is fucked |
yes and damn well fucked too |
up to my neck nearly |
not by him |
5~or~6 times handrunning

\f3:
there's the mark of his [\boylan] spunk on the clean sheet |
I~wouldn't bother to even iron it out |
that ought to satisfy him [\bloom] |
if you don't believe me feel my belly |
unless I~made him stand there and put him into me |
I've a~mind to tell him every scrap and make him do it out in front of me |
serve him right |
it's all his own fault if I~am an adulteress |
as the thing in the gallery said

\F4:
O~much about it |
if that's all the harm ever we did in this vale of tears |
God knows it's not much |
doesn't everybody |
only they hide it I~suppose |
that's what a~woman is supposed to be there for |
or He [\ourlord] wouldn't have made us the way He did |
so attractive to men

\f4:
\gab{1520}
then if he [\bloom] wants to kiss my bottom |
I'll drag open my drawers and bulge it right out in his face as large as life |
he can stick his tongue 7~miles up my hole |
as he's there |
my brown part

\f4:
then I'll tell him I~want~¬£1 or perhaps~30/- |
I'll tell him I~want to buy underclothes |
then if he gives me that |
well he won't be too bad |
I~don't want to soak it all out of him
like other women do |
I~could often have written out a~fine cheque for myself |
and write his name on it for a~couple of pounds |
a~few times he forgot to lock it up |
besides |
he won't spend it

\f4:
I'll let him do it off on me behind |
provided he doesn't smear all my good drawers |
O~I~suppose that can't be helped

\f4:
I'll do the indifferent |
1~or~2 questions |
I'll know by the answers |
when he's like that |
he can't keep a~thing back |
\gab{1530}
I~know every turn in him

\f4:
I'll tighten my bottom well and let out a~few smutty words |
smellrump or lick my shit or the first mad thing comes into my head |
then I'll suggest about |
yes O~wait now sonny |
my turn is coming |
I'll be quite gay and friendly over it

\F5:
O~but I~was forgetting this bloody pest of a~thing |
pfooh you wouldn't know which to laugh or cry |
we're such a~mixture of plum and apple |
no I'll have to wear the old things |
so much the better

\f5:
it'll be more pointed |
he'll never know whether he did it or not |
there that's good enough for you |
any old thing at all |
then I'll wipe him off me just like a~business |
his omission |
then I'll go out |
I'll have him eying up at the ceiling |
where is she gone now |
make him want me |
that's the only way

\F1:
\gab{1540}
a~quarter after |
what an unearthly hour |
I~suppose they're just getting up in China now |
combing out their pigtails for the day |
we'll soon have the nuns ringing the angelus |
they've nobody coming in to spoil their sleep |
except an odd priest or two for his night office |
or the alarmclock next door at cockshout |
clattering the brains out of itself |
let me see if I~can doze off

\f1:
1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5

\F2:
what kind of flowers are those they invented like the stars |
the wallpaper in Lombard street was much nicer

\f2:
the apron he gave me was like that |
something |
only I~only wore it twice

\f2:
better lower this lamp and try again |
so as I~can get up early |
I'll go to Lambe's there beside Findlater's
and get them to send us some flowers to put about the place |
in case he [\bloom] brings him [\stephen] home tomorrow

\f2:
today I~mean |
\gab{1550}
no no |
Friday's an unlucky day

\f2:
first I~want to do the place up someway |
the dust grows in it I~think while I'm asleep |
then we can have music and cigarettes

\f2:
I~can accompany him [\stephen]

\f2:
first I~must clean the keys of the piano with milk

\f2:
what'll I~wear |
shall~I wear a~white rose

\f2:
or those fairy cakes in Lipton's |
I~love the smell of a~rich big shop |
at 7~1/2d a~lb |
or the other ones with the cherries in them and the pinky sugar |
11d |
a~couple of lbs of those |
a~nice plant for the middle of the table |
I'd get that cheaper in |
wait where's this I~saw them not long ago

\F3:
I~love flowers |
I'd love to have the whole place swimming in roses |
God of heaven there's nothing like nature |
the wild mountains then the sea and the waves rushing |
then the beautiful country
\gab{1560}
with the fields of oats and wheat and all kinds of things |
and all the fine cattle going about |
that would do your heart good to see |
rivers and lakes and flowers |
all sorts of shapes and smells and colours springing up |
even out of the ditches |
primroses and violets |
nature it is

\F4:
as for them saying there's no God |
I~wouldn't give a~snap of my two fingers for all their learning |
why don't they go and create something

\f4:
I~often asked him [\bloom] |
atheists or whatever they call themselves |
go and wash the cobbles off themselves first |
then they go howling for the priest and they dying and why |
why because they're afraid of Hell on account of their bad conscience |
ah yes |
I~know them well |
who was the first person in the universe before there was anybody
that made it all |
who |
ah that they don't know |
neither do~I |
\gab{1570}
so there you are |
they might as well try to stop the sun from rising tomorrow

\M2:
the sun shines for you

\F5:
he [\bloom] said the day we were lying among the rhododendrons on Howth head |
in the grey tweed suit and his straw hat |
the day I~got him to propose to me

\f5:
yes

\f5:
first I~gave him the bit of seedcake out of my mouth |
and it was leapyear like now

\f5:
yes |
16~years ago |
my God after that long kiss |
I~near lost my breath

\f5:
yes

\M2:
You are a~flower of the mountain

\F5:
yes |
so we are flowers |
all a~woman's body

\f5:
yes |
that was one true thing he said in his life

\M2:
and the sun shines for you today

\F5:
yes |
that was why I~liked him |
because I~saw he understood or felt what a~woman is |
and I~knew I~could always get round him

\F1:
and I~gave him all the pleasure I~could |
\gab{1580}
leading him on |
till he asked me to say yes

\f1:
and I~wouldn't answer first |
only looked out over the sea and the sky

\f1:
I~was thinking of so many things he didn't know of |
Mulvey and Mr Stanhope and Hester and father and old captain Groves

\f1:
and the sailors playing all birds fly |
and I~say stoop |
and washing up dishes |
they called it on the pier

\f1:
and the sentry in front of the governor's house |
with the thing round his white helmet |
poor devil half roasted

\f1:
and the Spanish girls laughing in their shawls and their tall combs

\F2:
and the auctions in the morning |
the Greeks and the jews and the Arabs and the devil knows who else |
from all the ends of Europe

\f2:
and Duke street and the fowl market all clucking outside Larby Sharon's

\f2:
\gab{1590}
and the poor donkeys slipping half asleep

\f2:
and the vague fellows in the cloaks |
asleep in the shade on the steps

\f2:
and the big wheels of the carts of the bulls

\f2:
and the old castle |
thousands of years old

\f2:
yes |
and those handsome Moors |
all in white and turbans like kings |
asking you to sit down in their little bit of a~shop

\F3:
and Ronda with the old windows of the posadas |
\song{2~glancing eyes a~lattice hid} |
for her lover to kiss the iron

\f3:
and the wineshops |
half open at night |
and the castanets

\f3:
and the night we missed the boat at Algeciras

\f3:
the watchman going about serene with his lamp

\f3:
and O~that awful deepdown torrent

\f3:
O~and the sea |
the sea crimson sometimes |
like fire

\F4:
and the glorious sunsets |
and the figtrees in the Alameda gardens

\f4:
yes

\f4:
and all the queer little streets

\f4:
\gab{1600}
and the pink and blue and yellow houses

\f4:
and the rosegardens and the jessamine and geraniums and cactuses

\f4:
and Gibraltar as a~girl where I~was a~Flower of the mountain

\F5:
yes

\f5:
when I~put the rose in my hair like the Andalusian girls used

\f5:
or shall I~wear a~red

\f5:
yes

\f5:
and how he kissed me under the Moorish wall

\f5:
and I~thought well as well him as another

\f5:
and then I~asked him with my eyes to ask again

\f5:
yes

\f5:
and then he asked me

\M2:
would you

\F5:
yes

\M2:
say yes |
my mountain flower

\F5:
and first I~put my arms around him

\f5:
yes

\f5:
and drew him down to me

\f5:
so he could feel my breasts all perfume

\f5:
yes

\f5:
and his heart was going like mad and

\f5:
yes I~said

\f5:
yes I~will

\f5:
Yes.
