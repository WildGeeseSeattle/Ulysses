<h1>Two Gallants</h1>

<p>The grey warm evening of August had descended upon the city
and a mild warm air, a memory of summer, circulated in the
streets. The streets, shuttered for the repose of Sunday, swarmed
with a gaily coloured crowd. Like illumined pearls the lamps
shone from the summits of their tall poles upon the living texture
below which, changing shape and hue unceasingly, sent up into the
warm grey evening air an unchanging, unceasing murmur.</p>

<p>Two young men came down the hill of Rutland Square. One of
them was just bringing a long monologue to a close. The other,
who walked on the verge of the path and was at times obliged to
step on to the road, owing to his companion's rudeness, wore an
amused listening face. He was squat and ruddy. A yachting cap
was shoved far back from his forehead and the narrative to which
he listened made constant waves of expression break forth over his
face from the corners of his nose and eyes and mouth. Little jets of
wheezing laughter followed one another out of his convulsed body.
His eyes, twinkling with cunning enjoyment, glanced at every
moment towards his companion's face. Once or twice he
rearranged the light waterproof which he had slung over one
shoulder in toreador fashion. His breeches, his white rubber shoes
and his jauntily slung waterproof expressed youth. But his figure
fell into rotundity at the waist, his hair was scant and grey and his
face, when the waves of expression had passed over it, had a
ravaged look.</p>

<p>When he was quite sure that the narrative had ended he laughed
noiselessly for fully half a minute. Then he said:</p>

<p>"Well!... That takes the biscuit!"</p>

<p>His voice seemed winnowed of vigour; and to enforce his words he
added with humour:</p>

<p>"That takes the solitary, unique, and, if I may so call it,
<i>recherché</i> biscuit! "</p>
